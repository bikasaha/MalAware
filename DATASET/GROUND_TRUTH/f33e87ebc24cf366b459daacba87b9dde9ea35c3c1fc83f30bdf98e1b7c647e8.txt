The malware exhibits significant behavioral and functional intelligence indicative of a sophisticated threat. Behavioral analysis reveals that the malware allocates memory with read-write-execute permissions, a common tactic for self-unpacking or execution. It creates and executes files in the AppData folder (msieckc.exe), establishes persistence via autorun registry keys, and modifies proxy settings to potentially intercept traffic. Functionally, it demonstrates anti-virtualization tactics, such as querying CPU and network adapter details, suggesting an effort to avoid detection in virtualized environments. Network analysis shows frequent UDP communications with multicast addresses, indicative of potential lateral movement or command-and-control signaling. The malware's interactions with system components, including creating mutexes and modifying system registries, align with advanced persistence mechanisms, and its payload dropper behavior points to a multiphase infection strategy. These findings collectively suggest that the analyzed malware poses a severe threat with evasion, persistence, and network communication capabilities.
