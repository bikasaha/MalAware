The behavioral and network analysis of the malware sample reveals its advanced anti-sandboxing and persistence tactics. The sample exhibits anti-sandboxing behavior by using sleep delays (antisandbox_sleep) and querying virtual machine-specific indicators like network adapters (antivm_network_adapters) and CPU details (antivm_generic_cpu). It drops and executes malicious files (acroedit.exe) in the AppData folder, modifies Windows registry for persistence (persistence_autorun), and deletes executed files to evade detection. The malware also modifies WPAD proxy settings for potential traffic interception. Network analysis highlights UDP traffic to local broadcast and multicast addresses, potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functionally, the malware adjusts memory protections to execute code stealthily (protection_rx) and scans for processes and host configurations, indicating reconnaissance capabilities. These behaviors suggest an evasive malware with both data exfiltration and persistence mechanisms.
