The malware analysis report reveals significant behavioral and network activity indicative of sophisticated malicious intent. Behaviorally, the sample allocates multiple read-write-execute memory regions, suggesting self-unpacking capabilities commonly associated with obfuscation and evasion. It exhibits high entropy in critical sections, indicative of encrypted or compressed data, and interacts with system libraries like ntdll, kernel32.dll, and advapi32.dll, pointing to potential exploitation of system-level functionality. Registry access patterns show extensive interaction with .NET framework-related keys, aligning with its PE32 executable nature. On the network front, the malware communicates extensively over UDP with multicast addresses (224.0.0.252) and local broadcast domains, leveraging ports like 5355 for service discovery. The absence of DNS or HTTP traffic suggests a focus on local reconnaissance or lateral movement rather than external command-and-control (C2). This functional intelligence underscores the malware's likely intent to evade detection, maintain persistence, and potentially escalate privileges within a Windows environment.
