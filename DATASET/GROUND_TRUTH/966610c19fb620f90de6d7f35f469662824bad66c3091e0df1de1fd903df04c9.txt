The analyzed malware exhibits significant behavioral and functional characteristics indicative of a sophisticated threat. Behavioral analysis highlights its ability to bypass sandbox detection through extended sleep delays and monitoring foreground window changes to detect user inactivity. It demonstrates persistence by creating registry keys for autorun at startup and performs process injection using API calls like NtMapViewOfSection to manipulate non-child process memory. Additionally, it acts as an infostealer with keylogging capabilities, employing hooks like SetWindowsHookExW to capture keyboard inputs. Network analysis reveals UDP communication with multicast and broadcast addresses, suggesting reconnaissance or lateral movement, though no HTTP or DNS traffic was detected. Functional intelligence suggests the malware is packed, as indicated by high entropy in binary sections, and it allocates executable memory to potentially unpack and execute itself. These attributes, combined with its capability to manipulate files, registry keys, and processes, underscore its multi-faceted threat profile targeting system integrity and confidentiality.
