The malware sample analyzed exhibits behavior consistent with advanced malicious techniques aimed at evasion, persistence, and execution. Behaviorally, it allocates executable memory regions using system APIs (NtAllocateVirtualMemory), potentially to unpack itself in memory, and alters memory protections to executable-only (NtProtectVirtualMemory) to avoid detection. It creates and executes scripts (google_update_checker.js) via Wscript with hidden windows to disguise its operations, and writes executables to the disk (wscript.exe). Additionally, the malware ensures persistence by modifying critical Windows Registry keys (HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) to execute itself at startup.

Network analysis indicates the malware communicates over UDP, targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or reconnaissance. No HTTP or DNS traffic was observed, suggesting reliance on non-standard protocols. Functionally, the malware loads various Windows DLLs and interacts heavily with system resources, indicating an intent to integrate deeply into the operating system's operations.

The sample's focus on memory manipulation, stealth execution, and persistence highlights its potential use for long-term compromise in targeted attacks. Its use of scripting and hidden windows aligns with common tactics employed by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
