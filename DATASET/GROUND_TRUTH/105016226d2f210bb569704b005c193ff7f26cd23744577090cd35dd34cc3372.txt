The analysis of the provided Cuckoo Sandbox report reveals a sophisticated malware sample employing several evasion and persistence techniques. Behavioral analysis highlights anti-sandboxing tactics such as intentional delays (antisandbox_sleep) and virtualization detection (antivm_generic_cpu, antivm_vmware_in_instruction). The malware also creates executable files in the AppData folder, modifies registry keys for autorun (persistence_autorun), and manipulates proxy configurations (modifies_proxy_wpad). Network analysis indicates UDP traffic targeting multicast addresses and DNS-like behavior to suspicious domains such as twilightparadox.com and phpnet.us, suggesting potential command-and-control (C2) communication. Functional intelligence reveals the malware's capability to drop executables, inject into processes, and modify registry settings, showcasing a multifaceted design aimed at maintaining stealth and control. This combination of evasion, persistence, and network communication underlines its advanced threat nature, likely aligned with targeted attacks or espionage objectives.
