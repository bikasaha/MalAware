The malware exhibits sophisticated behaviors designed to evade detection and analysis, as revealed by its behavioral and network indicators. Key actions include memory allocation with read-write-execute permissions (NtProtectVirtualMemory) for potential code unpacking and the creation of hidden processes to manipulate execution flows stealthily. Anti-analysis techniques, such as sleep delays and virtualization checks (e.g., BIOS and SCSI registry queries, VirtualBox and VMware artifacts), were observed, indicating attempts to avoid sandbox environments. Additionally, the malware actively interacts with the file system, dropping executables and DLLs in user directories (AppData) and creating suspicious directories (ATI_Subsystem). Network analysis revealed UDP communication patterns with multicast addresses and potential beaconing activity, suggesting the malware may exfiltrate data or coordinate with command-and-control (C&C) servers. Functional intelligence highlights its ability to terminate remote processes (NtTerminateProcess), execute WMI queries targeting security products, and leverage Windows utilities for persistence and cleanup. These findings underscore its capacity for persistence, stealth, and adversarial adaptability.
