The behavioral analysis from the Cuckoo Sandbox report reveals a range of suspicious activities indicative of malware behavior. The analyzed sample allocates executable memory regions and exhibits anti-sandbox techniques, including monitoring foreground window changes and delaying execution with extended sleep commands. It drops executable files into critical directories such as AppData and attempts to establish persistence by creating hidden files and scheduling autorun tasks. The network analysis shows multiple UDP broadcasts and multicasts to local and reserved IP ranges, suggesting potential reconnaissance or lateral movement activities. Functionally, the sample leverages high-entropy packed sections, indicative of obfuscation, and attempts to evade detection by deleting executed files. These characteristics, combined with the presence of anti-VMware techniques and the ability to drop and execute binaries, underscore its sophistication and capability to conduct malicious operations effectively.
