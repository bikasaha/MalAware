The malware exhibits advanced techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. Behavioral analysis highlights process injection activities involving memory manipulation and writing within non-child processes, which are common in code injection strategies. The sample also employs anti-sandbox techniques, such as delaying execution with sleep commands and monitoring user activity through foreground window checks. Functional intelligence reveals persistence mechanisms, including autorun registration via the Windows registry and shortcut creation. Network analysis shows UDP communication with multicast and broadcast addresses, indicating potential reconnaissance or command-and-control (C2) capabilities. The executable's behavior suggests it is likely a dropper or a loader, intended to establish a foothold for additional payload delivery.
