The provided Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals significant behavioral and network activities indicative of malicious behavior. Behavioral Analysis: The analyzed malware exhibits typical characteristics of advanced threats, such as allocating read-write-execute memory (potential unpacking behavior), creating hidden windows, and attempting persistence through registry key modifications and Alternate Data Streams (ADS). The malware also demonstrates anti-analysis capabilities by attempting to stop active services, which could disable security tools. It creates and manipulates several files (e.g., vmount.bat, winprint.dll) and subsequently deletes executed files to evade detection. Network Analysis: The malware engages in frequent UDP communications with multicast addresses (e.g., 224.0.0.252) and local subnet broadcasts, suggesting reconnaissance or command-and-control signaling. No HTTP or DNS traffic was observed, but the use of high entropy binary sections indicates likely data obfuscation or packing. Functional Intelligence: The malware aims to establish persistence, execute payloads stealthily, and hinder detection mechanisms. Its ability to dynamically allocate memory and manipulate registry keys, combined with evidence of dropped executable files, positions it as a versatile and potentially dangerous threat. Further investigation into the extracted Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) is essential for containment and mitigation.
