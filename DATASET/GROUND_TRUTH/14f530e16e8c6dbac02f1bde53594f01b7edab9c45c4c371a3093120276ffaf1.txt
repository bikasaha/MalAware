The malware analysis report from Cuckoo Sandbox reveals critical behavioral and network insights. Behavioral Analysis: The sample aggressively allocates and modifies memory with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions, indicating unpacking or obfuscation activities typical of malware. It interacts heavily with the Windows registry (RegOpenKeyExW called 62 times) and file system, including creating, opening, and deleting files in system directories, suggesting attempts at configuration or persistence. The sample loaded multiple DLLs, such as AdvApi32.dll and mscoree.dll, indicative of its reliance on Windows APIs for execution and potential evasion tactics. Network Analysis: The malware communicates over UDP with several multicast addresses (224.0.0.252), possibly leveraging network discovery or exfiltration channels. No HTTP, DNS, or ICMP traffic was observed, limiting its immediate external interactions. Functional Intelligence: The executable, identified as a .NET assembly, relies on the .NET framework for its functionality, enabling cross-platform execution and obfuscation ease. This behavior aligns with malware designed for stealth and adaptability, likely targeting system vulnerabilities for espionage or disruption. The high score (0.8) and observed tactics underscore a significant threat level.
