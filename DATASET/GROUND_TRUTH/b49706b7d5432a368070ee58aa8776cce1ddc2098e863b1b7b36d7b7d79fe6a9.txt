The analyzed malware, identified as a PE32 executable targeting Windows systems, demonstrates behaviors typical of self-modifying or unpacking code, as indicated by repeated allocations of read-write-execute memory using APIs like NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory. These actions suggest the presence of packed or encrypted payloads, further corroborated by the detection of high entropy in the binary's .text section. Functionally, the malware interacts extensively with system libraries and registry keys, indicative of environment reconnaissance or persistence mechanism setup. Network analysis reveals UDP communication with multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or command-and-control activities. Overall, the sample exhibits traits aligning with advanced evasion techniques and potentially modular capabilities, requiring further dynamic analysis for comprehensive attribution and mitigation.
