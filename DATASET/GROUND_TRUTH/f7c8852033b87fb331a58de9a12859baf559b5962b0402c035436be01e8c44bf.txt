The malware analysis using Cuckoo Sandbox reveals sophisticated behavioral and network tactics. Behavioral analysis indicates the malware uses anti-sandbox techniques, such as detecting foreground window changes and delaying execution via sleep commands, to evade detection. It employs persistence mechanisms, creating autorun tasks and hidden files, and uses stealth techniques like creating hidden windows and deleting executed files to minimize traceability. The malware demonstrates capabilities as a dropper, depositing and executing binaries, and uses packed encryption or compression to conceal its payload. Network analysis highlights UDP communication to multicast addresses and broadcast domains, suggesting reconnaissance or data exfiltration intent. Functionally, the malware targets user directories, modifies registry keys, and operates from the AppData folder, with strong indicators of data obfuscation and persistence strategies. Overall, the malware demonstrates advanced evasion and operational intelligence, posing significant challenges for traditional detection systems.
