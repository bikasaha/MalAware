The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis highlights the behavioral and network characteristics of a malware sample. Behavioral Analysis reveals that the malware exhibits advanced persistence and evasion tactics, including allocating executable memory, dropping executables to critical system directories (AppData and ProgramData), and modifying registry keys related to system policies and configurations. It creates services for persistence and deletes traces of executed files. The presence of SeDebugPrivilege checks and mutex creation suggests potential privilege escalation and anti-sandboxing techniques. Network Analysis shows the malware engages in UDP communication targeting various ports such as DNS (53) and LLMNR (5355), indicating reconnaissance or lateral movement potential. Functional Intelligence suggests it uses WMI for process creation and drops executables (notably Nv.exe) linked with known PlugX RAT signatures. The integration of simplified Chinese language resources in the PE file hints at regional targeting or origin. The severity of the actions, including creating and manipulating files, services, and memory regions, makes it a high-risk threat with modular functionality, possibly designed for stealthy and persistent infiltration.
