The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals that the malware exhibits sophisticated behavioral and functional characteristics indicative of advanced persistence and data exfiltration tactics. Behaviorally, the malware executes JavaScript, creates executable files in user directories (e.g., AppData), and spawns suspicious processes such as gupdate.exe, often used as droppers. It also manipulates system utilities like cmd.exe and leverages UPX compression, as evidenced by high entropy sections, to obscure its payload. Network activity highlights UDP communication with multicast and broadcast addresses, suggesting reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts. Functionally, the malware includes mechanisms for system interrogation, privilege escalation (e.g., checking SeShutdownPrivilege), and HTTP-based C2 communication, inferred from JavaScript embedded URLs. The analysis underscores its multi-faceted approach to persistence, obfuscation, and potential data exfiltration.
