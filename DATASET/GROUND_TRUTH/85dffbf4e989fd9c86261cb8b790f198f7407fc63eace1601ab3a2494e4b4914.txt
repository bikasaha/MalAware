The analysis of the malware sample highlights sophisticated behaviors aimed at obfuscation, persistence, and potential data exfiltration. Behavioral analysis indicates the malware employs process injection techniques (NtSetContextThread, WriteProcessMemory) and anti-sandbox mechanisms, including delaying execution (NtDelayExecution) and detecting virtual environments through adapter checks. It achieves persistence by creating autorun registry keys and modifying WPAD proxy settings for traffic interception. Network analysis shows UDP traffic targeting multicast addresses, which may facilitate lateral movement or C2 communication. Functional intelligence reveals the malware drops and executes binaries in the user AppData folder, creates directories, and dynamically loads several DLLs for network and system interaction. These behaviors underscore its capability to remain undetected while performing malicious operations, emphasizing the need for robust detection strategies.
