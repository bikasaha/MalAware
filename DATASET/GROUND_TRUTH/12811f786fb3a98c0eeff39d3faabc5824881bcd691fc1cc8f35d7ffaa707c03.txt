The behavioral analysis of the malware sample executed in the Cuckoo Sandbox reveals suspicious activities indicative of stealthy and persistent threat behavior. The malware employs anti-sandbox techniques, such as delaying execution via prolonged sleep calls and detecting virtual machine environments by querying network adapter details and CPU identifiers. It creates and modifies executable files in user directories, including igfxext.exe, which is also set to autorun on system startup, ensuring persistence. Process injection techniques, such as memory writing and thread manipulation, are evident, enabling the malware to modify and execute code within legitimate processes.

Network analysis shows significant UDP traffic to multicast addresses, particularly targeting ports like 5355 and 1900, potentially leveraging network discovery or data exfiltration techniques. No HTTP or DNS traffic was recorded, suggesting the malware may employ unconventional communication channels or obfuscation.

From a functional intelligence perspective, the malwareâ€™s capabilities include creating directories, writing to the Windows registry, loading numerous DLLs, and executing processes with elevated persistence. It manipulates proxy configurations for potential traffic interception and demonstrates advanced process injection techniques, such as leveraging WriteProcessMemory and NtSetContextThread. Overall, this sample exhibits hallmark traits of a sophisticated threat actor aiming for stealth, persistence, and operational capability.
