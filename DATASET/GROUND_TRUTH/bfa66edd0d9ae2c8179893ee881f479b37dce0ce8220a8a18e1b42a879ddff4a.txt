The malware analyzed exhibits suspicious behaviors including memory allocation with read-write-execute permissions, indicative of self-unpacking techniques. It operates as a PE32 executable targeting Windows systems and likely employs packing mechanisms, as evidenced by high entropy values in its .text section. Network analysis reveals significant UDP traffic, with multiple broadcasts to local and multicast addresses, suggesting reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functionally, it interacts with critical Windows components, such as checking for SeDebugPrivilege, and performs frequent registry key and file operations. The observed API calls, including NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory, along with cryptographic activities, point towards evasion tactics and potential data manipulation. Overall, the behavior suggests a complex threat leveraging advanced anti-analysis techniques and network reconnaissance capabilities.
