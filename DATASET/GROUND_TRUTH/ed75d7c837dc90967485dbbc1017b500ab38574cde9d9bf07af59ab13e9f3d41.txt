The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis indicates a malware sample exhibiting anti-sandboxing and evasion techniques, coupled with significant file system manipulations and potential persistence strategies. The malware actively delays analysis by employing sleep functions and monitors human activity by tracking foreground window changes. Behavioral observations reveal the creation of hidden files and directories, such as executable files in AppData and system-level task files, alongside modifications to the registry and the deletion of executed files, likely to evade detection. The binary shows high entropy, suggesting packing or encryption. Network analysis highlights UDP communications targeting local and multicast addresses, potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement. The malware establishes persistence through autorun configurations and drops additional payloads, indicative of a dropper functionality. These characteristics, combined with process injection attempts and hidden window creation, align with sophisticated tactics employed by advanced malware to bypass detection and maintain a foothold in compromised systems.
