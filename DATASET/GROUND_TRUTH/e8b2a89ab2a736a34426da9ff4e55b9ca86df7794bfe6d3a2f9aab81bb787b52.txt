The malware analyzed exhibits behaviors consistent with advanced evasion and persistence techniques. It allocates executable memory (RWX) and modifies memory protection attributes to execute injected code stealthily, often a hallmark of self-unpacking or payload delivery mechanisms. It leverages NtProtectVirtualMemory and NtAllocateVirtualMemory APIs extensively, indicating a focus on process manipulation. Functionally, the malware creates executable files in system-critical locations, such as the AppData folder, and achieves persistence by modifying the registry to autorun on startup. High entropy in its binary suggests packing or encryption, commonly used to obfuscate malicious intent.

Network analysis reveals UDP traffic originating from the infected host, targeting multicast addresses, likely to discover or communicate with other devices stealthily. It also attempts to connect to an external IP, indicating potential C2 communication. The malware actively checks for virtualization using network adapter queries (GetAdaptersAddresses), likely to evade sandbox analysis. Notably, it deletes its executable traces post-execution, reinforcing its stealth characteristics. These features, combined with its ability to escalate privileges and stop critical services, highlight its sophisticated functionality aimed at long-term system compromise and detection avoidance.
