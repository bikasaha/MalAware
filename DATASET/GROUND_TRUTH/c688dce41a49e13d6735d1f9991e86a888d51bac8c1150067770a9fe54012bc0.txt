The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals malicious behavior and network activity indicative of a sophisticated threat. Behavioral analysis shows evidence of self-unpacking (allocating RWX memory) and persistence mechanisms through the creation of autorun tasks. Anti-analysis techniques, including detection of virtual environments and delaying analysis with sleep calls, highlight evasion capabilities. The malware creates multiple hidden and executable files, indicating it drops and executes payloads, and implements a keylogger to monitor keyboard inputs. Functional intelligence indicates the use of high-entropy packed sections, suggesting the presence of obfuscation or encryption. From a network perspective, the malware generates numerous UDP connections, primarily targeting multicast addresses and local networks, likely for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Overall, the report underscores a potent threat employing evasion, persistence, and reconnaissance techniques, with a focus on data exfiltration and environmental awareness.
