The analysis of the provided malware report from the Cuckoo Sandbox reveals significant behavioral, network, and functional intelligence details. The malware exhibits persistence by creating executables (actmove.exe, actmove.dll, and actmove.sys) in critical system directories and installs itself for autorun via registry keys. It attempts to evade detection by identifying antivirus software through registry keys and trying to stop active security services. Process injection activity is evident, as a remote thread is resumed in another process, which is often associated with stealthy execution. Networking analysis shows UDP traffic targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, indicating possible reconnaissance or lateral movement. Notably, the malware attempts to detect virtualized environments using VMware-specific features, suggesting efforts to avoid sandbox analysis. Functionally, the malware's API activity, such as creating and starting services (CreateServiceA) and extensive registry modifications, reflects its intent to maintain control over the compromised system. Overall, the behavior aligns with sophisticated techniques for persistence, anti-detection, and potential lateral movement in a networked environment.
