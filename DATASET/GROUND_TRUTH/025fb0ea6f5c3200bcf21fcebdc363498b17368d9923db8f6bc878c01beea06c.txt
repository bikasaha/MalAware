The malware exhibits several suspicious behaviors and functionalities indicative of sophisticated evasion and persistence techniques. Behavioral analysis reveals the allocation of executable memory for likely unpacking itself (NtAllocateVirtualMemory), attempts to delay analysis using sleep commands (antisandbox_sleep), and creation of hidden files and processes (stealth_window). The malware establishes persistence via autorun tasks and performs actions consistent with a keylogger (SetWindowsHookExW), which could be indicative of credential theft. Functional intelligence suggests the binary is packed, with high entropy sections detected, pointing to possible obfuscation or encryption. From a network perspective, the malware generates UDP traffic to broadcast addresses, which might indicate reconnaissance or data exfiltration capabilities. It drops and executes binaries in system directories, including hidden and temporary locations, and deletes them post-execution to cover its tracks. These combined behaviors highlight a targeted effort to maintain stealth, harvest sensitive information, and resist detection, necessitating further analysis to identify its specific objectives and threat actor associations.
