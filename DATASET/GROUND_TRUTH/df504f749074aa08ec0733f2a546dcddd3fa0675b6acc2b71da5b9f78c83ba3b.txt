The behavioral analysis of the submitted malware sample reveals advanced evasion techniques, including anti-sandbox mechanisms such as detecting human activity through foreground window changes and intentional sleep delays to thwart automated analysis. The sample creates multiple executable and hidden files in sensitive locations like the AppData and Windows\Tasks directories, employs persistence strategies by setting autorun tasks, and deletes its own executed files to minimize forensic traces. Functional intelligence highlights its capability to act as a dropper, deploying additional binaries, and utilizing high-entropy-packed sections suggestive of obfuscation. Network activity indicates UDP communications, particularly with multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially aiming for lateral movement or data exfiltration. The malwareâ€™s behavior aligns with stealthy and persistent attack patterns, making it a significant threat.
