The behavioral and network analysis of the submitted malware sample highlights significant malicious activities. The malware exhibits multiple anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization techniques, such as delaying execution through extended sleep calls, checking virtual machine-specific artifacts like adapter addresses and CPU identifiers, and modifying thread contexts indicative of code injection. Functional intelligence reveals that the malware performs process injections, modifies Windows registry keys, and manipulates network configurations to potentially intercept traffic using WPAD proxy settings. Network activity is characterized by frequent UDP connections targeting multicast addresses, likely indicating attempts to scan or exploit local network resources. Overall, the malware employs sophisticated evasion and injection techniques, aiming for stealth and persistence in compromised environments.
