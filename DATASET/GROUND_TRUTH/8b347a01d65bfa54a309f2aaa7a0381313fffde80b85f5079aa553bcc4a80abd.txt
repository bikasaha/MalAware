The analyzed malware exhibits sophisticated anti-sandboxing techniques, including checks for foreground window activity and intentional delays in execution to hinder analysis. It creates and executes multiple files in sensitive locations such as AppData and Windows\Tasks, some of which are hidden or system files, indicating persistence and evasion tactics. Additionally, it deletes executed files to erase evidence and uses high entropy sections in its binary, suggestive of packing or encryption to obfuscate its payload. On the network side, the malware generates extensive UDP traffic, primarily targeting multicast addresses and ports like 5355 and 137, often associated with local network reconnaissance or lateral movement. These behaviors, combined with indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as defrag.exe and D8EB.tmp, demonstrate its functional intent to persist on the system, evade detection, and potentially propagate or collect data within a networked environment.
