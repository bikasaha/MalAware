The analysis of the provided malware sample reveals multiple suspicious behaviors and network activities indicative of potential threats. The behavioral analysis highlights the malware's capability to allocate and execute memory regions dynamically (NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory), a technique commonly associated with unpacking or obfuscating code. It also displays high entropy in specific executable sections (packer_entropy), suggesting possible encryption or compression to evade detection. The sample checks for system privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, further indicating potential malicious intent for privilege escalation. Network analysis reveals UDP traffic directed to broadcast and multicast addresses on various ports (e.g., 137, 5355), which could signal reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional intelligence points to its dependency on several system libraries and .NET framework components, alongside attempts to access critical registry keys and system configurations, demonstrating an understanding of the host environment. This combination of behaviors suggests a sophisticated approach to persistence, evasion, and possibly exfiltration, warranting further in-depth investigation and countermeasures.
