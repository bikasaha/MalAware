The malware report generated by Cuckoo Sandbox highlights several key findings regarding behavioral and network analysis. Behaviorally, the sample exhibits suspicious actions such as allocating read-write-execute (RWX) memory, which is commonly associated with unpacking and injecting code. Process injection techniques, including the use of NtSetContextThread and resuming threads in remote processes, were observed. High entropy in binary sections indicates the presence of obfuscated or packed content. DLL injections and modifications to registry keys further underscore attempts to evade detection or establish persistence. Network analysis reveals that the malware predominantly engages in UDP traffic, targeting multicast and broadcast IP ranges (e.g., 224.0.0.252 and 192.168.56.255) on ports like 137 and 5355, potentially indicative of reconnaissance or lateral movement activities. Functional intelligence reveals that the sample is a PE32 executable designed for the Windows platform, loaded multiple .NET and system libraries, and attempted to access files and configurations linked to its execution environment. These behaviors strongly suggest a sophisticated, likely modular malware attempting to blend into its execution environment while executing stealthy reconnaissance and injection tactics.
