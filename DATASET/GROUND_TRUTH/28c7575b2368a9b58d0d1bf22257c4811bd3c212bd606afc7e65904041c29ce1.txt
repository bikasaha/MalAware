The malware sample analyzed by Cuckoo Sandbox demonstrates significant behavioral and network activities indicative of sophisticated malicious capabilities. Behavioral analysis reveals the use of process injection techniques, including memory manipulation (NtAllocateVirtualMemory and WriteProcessMemory) and the creation of remote threads, likely to execute malicious payloads in other processes. The sample employs anti-sandbox techniques, such as monitoring foreground window changes and inducing artificial delays using sleep functions. It also drops and executes files in critical directories like AppData and attempts self-deletion via batch scripts, indicating stealth measures. Functional intelligence highlights privilege escalation attempts by querying sensitive privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, along with creating executable files and DLL manipulation. Network analysis shows UDP communication to multicast and broadcast addresses, targeting ports associated with local network services, suggesting reconnaissance or lateral movement activities. Overall, the malware exhibits traits of advanced threats capable of evading detection, injecting code into legitimate processes, and potentially propagating within a network.
