The analysis of the provided malware sample from the Cuckoo Sandbox reveals both stealth and persistence strategies, alongside suspicious behavioral and network activities. The malware employs anti-sandbox techniques such as monitoring foreground window changes and delaying execution, indicative of attempts to thwart analysis. It drops and executes binaries within system-critical paths like the AppData and Tasks folders, using hidden and system-level attributes for obfuscation. Network activity includes UDP communication to multicast addresses, which could suggest discovery or command-and-control (C2) mechanisms. Functionally, the malware demonstrates persistence by creating autorun tasks and deleting executed files to reduce forensic traces. High entropy in the executable sections implies the use of packers or encryption, which complicates static analysis. Overall, the sample combines evasion, persistence, and potential data exfiltration capabilities, aligning with behaviors often observed in sophisticated malicious campaigns.
