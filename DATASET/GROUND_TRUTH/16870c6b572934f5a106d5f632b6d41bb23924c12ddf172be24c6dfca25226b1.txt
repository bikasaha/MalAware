The behavioral analysis of the provided malware report highlights several suspicious activities, including memory allocation with execute permissions, indicative of potential unpacking routines, and attempts to delay analysis using sleep instructions for 312 seconds. The malware also demonstrates persistence mechanisms by creating services (javatmsup) that run executable files (ipmgr.exe) on system startup. It creates and subsequently deletes multiple executable files in the Windows SysWOW64 directory, suggesting anti-forensic behaviors. Network analysis shows the malware primarily engages in UDP communication with multicast and broadcast addresses (224.0.0.252, 239.255.255.250), targeting ports such as 5355 and 1900, which are associated with service discovery protocols, potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional intelligence indicates the binary may be packed due to high entropy sections, performs privilege checks (SeDebugPrivilege), and accesses multiple registry keys and DLLs to manipulate system settings and evade detection. These behaviors collectively suggest a sophisticated malware variant with anti-analysis and persistence capabilities, possibly designed for data exfiltration or system compromise in a stealthy manner.
