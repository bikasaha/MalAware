The malware report reveals significant behavioral, network, and functional insights. Behaviorally, the malware allocates read-write-execute memory, indicating potential self-unpacking, and exhibits anti-sandbox behaviors such as querying Windows idle time and delaying analysis tasks through excessive sleep calls. It establishes persistence by creating an autorun entry in the Windows Registry. Functionally, the malware interacts with multiple DLLs and makes extensive registry and memory modifications, which align with its observed capabilities of altering system configurations. Network analysis shows UDP communications to multicast addresses (224.0.0.252 and 239.255.255.250) using various ports, suggesting reconnaissance or potential command-and-control activity. These behaviors indicate the malware's focus on evasion, system manipulation, and potential network propagation, highlighting its sophisticated and stealthy operational characteristics.
