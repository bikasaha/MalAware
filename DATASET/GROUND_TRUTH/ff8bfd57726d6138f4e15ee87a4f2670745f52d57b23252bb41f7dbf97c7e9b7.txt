The malware analyzed exhibits notable behavioral, network, and functional characteristics. Behavioral analysis reveals its ability to create multiple executable and DLL files in the AppData directory, indicative of potential payload delivery and execution. It actively interacts with various registry keys, loads numerous DLLs, and manipulates files extensively. Network analysis shows UDP traffic originating from the infected host to multicast addresses, possibly signaling data exfiltration or beaconing behavior to command-and-control (C2) servers. Functional intelligence highlights its reliance on Python-based modules and libraries (e.g., python27.dll, _hashlib.pyd), suggesting it leverages a Python runtime for execution. Additionally, it resolves suspicious domains and uses standard APIs, such as file manipulation and memory allocation, demonstrating sophisticated evasion and persistence techniques. The sample's high score and diverse functionalities make it a significant threat to system integrity and confidentiality.
