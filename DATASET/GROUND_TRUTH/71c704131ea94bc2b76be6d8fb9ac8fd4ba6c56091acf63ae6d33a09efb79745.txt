The malware exhibits sophisticated anti-analysis behaviors, including detecting sandbox environments through checks on foreground window activity, employing sleep delays to hinder automated analysis, and leveraging specific instructions to identify virtualized environments (e.g., VMware detection). Its functional capabilities include creating executables and hidden files, establishing persistence through autorun mechanisms, and functioning as a dropper by executing additional payloads from temporary directories. Behavioral indicators suggest the presence of a keylogging component and techniques to delete executed files to evade forensic recovery. The binary also shows characteristics of packing, indicated by high entropy sections, suggesting encrypted or compressed content to obfuscate its intent. Network activity includes broadcasting UDP packets within the local subnet, but no direct malicious DNS or HTTP communication was observed. This analysis highlights the malwareâ€™s focus on stealth, persistence, and functional intelligence to execute and maintain control in compromised environments.
