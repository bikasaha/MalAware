The behavioral analysis reveals that the malware heavily relies on suspicious memory allocation and execution tactics, as evidenced by repeated calls to allocate Read-Write-Execute (RWX) memory using system APIs such as NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory. The process also attempts privilege escalation by checking for the SeDebugPrivilege, which could enable system-wide access. The binary exhibits high entropy in its .text section, indicative of packed or encrypted content, which often signifies an effort to evade detection. Network analysis shows notable UDP communication with multiple destinations, including multicast addresses like 224.0.0.252 and 239.255.255.250, on ports like 5355 (likely DNS-related traffic), which might indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts. Functionally, the malware interacts with numerous Windows system DLLs, potentially exploiting their functionalities, and demonstrates the ability to manipulate registry keys, read configuration files, and modify process memory, aligning with characteristics typical of sophisticated malware.
