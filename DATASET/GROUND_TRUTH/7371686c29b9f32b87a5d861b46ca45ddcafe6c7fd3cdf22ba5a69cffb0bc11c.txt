The analyzed malware exhibits behaviors indicative of advanced persistence and obfuscation techniques. Behaviorally, the malware allocates executable memory (NtAllocateVirtualMemory) likely for unpacking or injecting malicious payloads, creates and modifies hidden files to establish persistence (C:\Windows\Tasks\Sidebar_cuckoo2.job), and utilizes anti-sandbox techniques such as delaying execution (NtDelayExecution) and checking for human interaction. Functionally, it acts as a dropper, depositing executable files in user directories like AppData and executing them (BC5A.tmp, sidebar.exe), while also deleting traces post-execution to hinder forensic efforts. High entropy sections in the binary suggest compression or encryption, potentially to evade signature-based detection. Network-wise, the malware interacts with multicast addresses using UDP over port 5355, possibly for lateral movement or command-and-control initialization. These findings underline its stealth and resilience capabilities, warranting robust defensive measures for mitigation.
