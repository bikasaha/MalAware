The analyzed malware exhibits suspicious behavior and network activity indicative of a sophisticated threat. Behavioral analysis reveals frequent memory manipulation, including allocating and modifying executable memory, suggesting techniques like unpacking or process injection for stealth and execution. The malware employs anti-sandbox tactics, such as delaying execution and monitoring for user interaction, hinting at attempts to evade automated analysis environments. Network analysis shows UDP traffic targeting broadcast and multicast addresses, including port 5355, which is associated with DNS service discovery, potentially for lateral movement or command-and-control communication. Functional intelligence identifies the use of foreign-language resources and process injections, indicating potential targeted operations or advanced obfuscation strategies. Collectively, these observations underline the need for robust detection measures to counter such evasion and network exploitation techniques.
