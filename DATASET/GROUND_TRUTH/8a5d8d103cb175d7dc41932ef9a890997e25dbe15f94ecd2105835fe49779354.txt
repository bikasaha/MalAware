The analyzed malware exhibits a high threat level with a score of 8.0, demonstrating advanced capabilities for stealth and anti-analysis. Behavioral analysis indicates the malware allocates executable memory dynamically, drops and executes malicious files in the AppData directory, delays analysis with extended sleep periods, and creates hidden processes to evade detection. It interacts with critical registry keys, checks for privileged access (SeDebugPrivilege), and queries system processes, potentially for sandbox evasion or injection. Network analysis reveals multiple UDP communications, including broadcasts and multicast traffic, targeting ports like 137 and 5355, suggesting reconnaissance or lateral movement activities. Functional intelligence highlights the malware's anti-virtualization mechanisms, detecting VirtualBox and VMware through specific files and registry keys. Additionally, it leverages Windows utilities (e.g., TASKKILL) to manipulate and terminate processes, indicating an intent to maintain persistence and eliminate competing processes. Overall, the malware demonstrates a sophisticated blend of evasion tactics and functional exploits, warranting enhanced defensive measures.
