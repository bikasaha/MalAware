The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals a high-confidence detection of suspicious behavior with a score of 0.8. The malware allocated multiple regions of read-write-execute (RWX) memory, often associated with self-unpacking mechanisms. It heavily interacted with the Windows registry and filesystem, including opening numerous registry keys related to .NET Framework settings and modifying system-critical configuration files. The process accessed .NET and core Windows libraries, suggesting an attempt to leverage standard system functionalities. Network activity indicates UDP communication to broadcast and multicast IPs, potentially for discovery or command-and-control purposes. Functional intelligence highlights that the binary is a .NET PE32 executable designed for Windows, employing evasion tactics like debugger checks and vector-based exception handling to remain undetected. These behaviors align with malware aiming for persistence, reconnaissance, and stealthy operations within a compromised environment.
