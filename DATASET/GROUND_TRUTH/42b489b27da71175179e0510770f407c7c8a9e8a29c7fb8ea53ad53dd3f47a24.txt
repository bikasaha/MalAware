The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis indicates that the sample exhibits suspicious behavior consistent with malicious activity. Behavioral analysis reveals the frequent allocation of executable memory (e.g., NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory APIs), suggesting potential unpacking or injection mechanisms. Additionally, the malware creates hidden processes (cmd.exe with the whoami command) and checks for privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, hinting at stealth and elevated privilege intentions. Network analysis highlights UDP traffic targeting multicast and broadcast addresses (224.0.0.252 and 192.168.56.255) over ports like 137 and 5355, commonly associated with NetBIOS and LLMNR traffic, potentially used for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional intelligence reveals its use of legitimate Windows utilities and attempts to evade detection through hidden windows (CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag). Overall, the sample demonstrates behaviors typical of a stealthy and privilege-escalating malware targeting Windows environments.
