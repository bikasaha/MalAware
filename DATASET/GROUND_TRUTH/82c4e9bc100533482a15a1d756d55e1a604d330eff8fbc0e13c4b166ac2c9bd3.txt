The analyzed malware, detected in a Cuckoo Sandbox report, displays several characteristics indicative of sophisticated evasion and malicious intent. Behavioral Analysis reveals processes, such as rundll32.exe, executing functions to allocate executable memory (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE), indicative of unpacking and potential process injection. The malware employs sandbox evasion techniques, including deliberate delays (NtDelayExecution) and hidden window creation, and manipulates system settings like WPAD proxy configurations. Network Analysis shows repeated UDP communication with multicast and broadcast addresses, likely for lateral movement or reconnaissance. No HTTP or DNS activity was recorded, emphasizing the potential focus on local network exploitation. Functional Intelligence highlights malicious functionalities such as dropping binaries, modifying registry keys, and interacting with critical DLLs like mscrypto.dll. The malware also resumes threads in remote processes, indicative of injection activities. This blend of anti-analysis, evasion tactics, and direct system manipulation underscores its advanced and stealthy threat nature.
