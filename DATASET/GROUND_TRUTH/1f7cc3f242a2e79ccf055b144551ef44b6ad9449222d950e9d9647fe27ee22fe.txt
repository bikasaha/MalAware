The malware exhibits notable behavioral patterns indicative of sophisticated capabilities, including memory manipulation and persistence mechanisms. Behavioral analysis reveals that the sample allocates read-write-execute (RWX) memory, a common technique for unpacking and executing malicious payloads, and modifies registry keys to establish persistence by ensuring execution at Windows startup. The malware drops an executable (msieckc.exe) into the AppData directory, a tactic often used to avoid user suspicion. Network analysis identifies UDP traffic to multicast addresses, suggesting an attempt to locate or communicate with local or remote devices. It resolves hostnames, indicating potential C2 (Command and Control) communication, while connections to domains like myhome.serveuser.com and mobile.zapto.org further corroborate this suspicion. Functional intelligence highlights its anti-VM capabilities, which detect virtualized environments, and proxy configuration modifications to intercept network traffic. These behaviors, coupled with registry alterations and API calls for process and memory manipulation, underscore its multifaceted and evasive nature, making it a significant threat.
