The analyzed malware demonstrates characteristics indicative of advanced evasion and persistence techniques. Behavioral analysis reveals memory manipulation through the allocation of executable memory regions, suggesting self-unpacking or anti-analysis tactics. Additionally, it drops executables into sensitive directories like the user AppData folder and Windows System32, highlighting its potential for system compromise. The network analysis indicates frequent UDP communications with multicast and broadcast IPs, implying reconnaissance or propagation efforts. Functionally, the malware creates and deletes files strategically, including batch scripts and DLLs, which are critical for its execution and concealment. Registry modifications and alternate data stream usage further establish its persistence. The high entropy in its PE file sections suggests obfuscation, and attempts to stop system services reflect its disruptive intent. These behaviors collectively underscore a sophisticated threat capable of evasion, propagation, and persistence.
