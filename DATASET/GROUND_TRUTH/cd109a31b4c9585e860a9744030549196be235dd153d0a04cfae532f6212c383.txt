The malware analysis report reveals that the sample exhibits several anti-sandbox techniques, such as detecting foreground window changes and attempting to delay analysis by invoking sleep operations, demonstrating its intent to evade detection in virtualized environments. It creates and executes multiple executable files, including hidden and system files, to establish persistence and launch additional malicious processes. The sample's network activity includes UDP traffic targeting multicast and broadcast addresses on various ports, potentially signaling scanning or beaconing behavior. Behavioral analysis shows the creation and deletion of files, interaction with registry keys to modify system configurations, and loading of numerous dynamic link libraries (DLLs), indicating functionality enhancement. Functional intelligence highlights the sample's ability to drop, execute, and conceal binaries, as well as persistence mechanisms like autorun entries. The presence of high-entropy sections within the binary suggests the use of packing or encryption to obfuscate its payload. Overall, the malware demonstrates sophisticated techniques to establish persistence, evade detection, and potentially communicate with external command-and-control servers.
