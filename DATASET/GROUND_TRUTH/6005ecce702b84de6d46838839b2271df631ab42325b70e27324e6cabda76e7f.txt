The Cuckoo Sandbox report reveals the analyzed sample exhibited sophisticated behavioral patterns, including memory allocation with read-write-execute permissions for likely unpacking or dynamic code injection. The malware created and executed temporary files, dropped additional binaries, and altered registry keys, indicating persistence mechanisms and configuration storage. The use of high entropy sections suggests potential encryption or compression to obfuscate payloads. Network analysis showed UDP broadcast activity, targeting local network addresses for potential lateral movement or discovery, and no direct HTTP, DNS, or ICMP communications were observed. Functional intelligence highlighted attempts to stop critical system services (e.g., spooler service) and the deletion of executed files to evade forensic tracing. Collectively, these behaviors demonstrate capabilities for persistence, obfuscation, and potential lateral movement, marking this sample as a versatile and stealthy threat.
