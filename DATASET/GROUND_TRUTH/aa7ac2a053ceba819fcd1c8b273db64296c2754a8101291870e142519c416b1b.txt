The malware analysis reveals behavioral and network characteristics consistent with advanced evasion and system manipulation techniques. Behaviorally, the malware allocates substantial memory regions with read-write-execute (RWX) permissions, indicative of potential unpacking or self-modifying behavior, and demonstrates high entropy in its executable sections, suggesting obfuscation or packing. Registry activities include querying and modifying keys related to .NET framework configurations, highlighting its focus on integration with system-level components. Functionally, the malware checks for privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, often used for debugging or tampering with system processes, further emphasizing its intent for deep system interaction. On the network front, frequent UDP communications target multicast and broadcast addresses on ports commonly used for name resolution (e.g., port 5355), potentially probing or exfiltrating data. Overall, the report suggests a well-crafted payload capable of stealthy deployment and potential lateral movement within a network.
