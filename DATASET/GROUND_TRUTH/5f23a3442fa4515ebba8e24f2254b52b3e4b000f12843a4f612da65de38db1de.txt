The malware sample analyzed in the provided Cuckoo Sandbox report demonstrates sophisticated evasion techniques and impactful behaviors. Behaviorally, it allocates read-write-execute memory regions (indicative of unpacking itself), delays execution to evade sandbox analysis, and exhibits high entropy in certain sections, suggesting the use of encryption or compression (packer). The malware modifies registry keys to configure proxy settings and intercept traffic, drops multiple executable files in system directories, and deletes traces of its execution, including executed files, to conceal activity. It interacts with critical DLLs such as kernel32.dll and advapi32.dll, indicating extensive use of system-level APIs. Network analysis reveals that the malware attempts to connect to suspicious hosts (codec.servepics.com and sales.eu5.org), likely for command-and-control (C&C) communication, and generates UDP traffic targeting local broadcast and multicast addresses, potentially to propagate or gather network reconnaissance data. Functionally, it is designed to monitor and manipulate network configurations, evade analysis, and maintain persistence, as evidenced by repeated process and registry interactions. The inclusion of evasion strategies, traffic redirection, and stealth mechanisms underlines its intent for long-term, covert operations.
