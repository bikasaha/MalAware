The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals notable behavioral, network, and functional intelligence about the analyzed malware sample. The malware demonstrates process injection techniques, such as using NtSetContextThread and NtResumeThread, indicative of attempts to execute malicious payloads in remote processes. It allocates PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE memory and utilizes packing mechanisms, as evidenced by high entropy sections, to evade detection. Network activity primarily involves UDP communication, targeting multicast and broadcast IPs, potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functionally, the malware interacts with various registry keys and .NET framework-related DLLs, suggesting its compatibility with Windows environments and its reliance on .NET components for execution. This behavior indicates a sophisticated approach to evasion and persistence, likely aimed at targeted attacks.
