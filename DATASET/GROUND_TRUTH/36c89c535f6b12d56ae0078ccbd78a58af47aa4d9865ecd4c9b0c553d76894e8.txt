The malware analyzed by Cuckoo Sandbox exhibits multiple behaviors indicating sophistication and evasion techniques. Behavioral Analysis: The malware delays execution by inducing a 291-second sleep to evade sandbox detection and checks network adapter configurations to detect virtual environments. It also drops and executes files in the AppData folder, installs persistence mechanisms via autorun registry keys, and deletes traces after execution. Notably, the binary is UPX-packed, suggesting efforts to obfuscate its code. Network Analysis: The sample makes UDP requests to local broadcast and multicast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or network reconnaissance. No significant HTTP or DNS activity was detected, which might indicate stealth or reliance on non-standard communication channels. Functional Intelligence: The malware targets Windows systems, with indications of Japanese localization in the executableâ€™s resources. Its activities include proxy manipulation for potential traffic interception and repeated attempts to interact with specific processes like mobsync.exe. These characteristics highlight its likely objectives: persistence, stealth, and potential exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
