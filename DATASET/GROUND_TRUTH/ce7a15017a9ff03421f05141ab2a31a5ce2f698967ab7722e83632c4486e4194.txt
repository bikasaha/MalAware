The malware analysis reveals a variety of sophisticated behaviors and network activities aimed at persistence, stealth, and evasion. Behaviorally, the malware employs anti-sandbox techniques such as foreground window checks and sleep delays to thwart analysis, while also creating hidden and executable files within critical directories, such as AppData and Windows Tasks, to establish persistence. Functional intelligence suggests the use of high-entropy sections in its binary, indicative of compression or encryption, likely to obfuscate its payload. It executes dropped binaries, creates hidden processes, and installs autorun jobs for persistence. Additionally, the malware deletes executed files post-execution to minimize forensic footprints.

From a network perspective, the malware initiates frequent UDP communications, primarily directed to multicast addresses, which may indicate network reconnaissance or covert communication with a command-and-control (C2) server. The absence of HTTP and DNS traffic suggests potential reliance on alternative protocols for data exfiltration or command exchange. Overall, the malware exhibits advanced techniques for stealth, persistence, and potential lateral movement within a network.
