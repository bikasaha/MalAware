The analyzed malware exhibits sophisticated evasion and functionality techniques, as revealed by the behavioral and network analysis. Behaviorally, the malware allocates read-write-execute memory for unpacking, creates hidden windows, and uses multiple Windows utilities to execute tasks like process termination and file deletion, indicating its dynamic execution capabilities. It attempts to delay analysis by employing sleep functions and probes system privileges (e.g., checking for SeDebugPrivilege). Additionally, it leverages anti-sandbox and anti-virtualization strategies, such as querying BIOS information and detecting virtualized environments through file and registry artifacts. Functionally, the malware interacts with the filesystem extensively, creating and manipulating executable files and dynamically loaded libraries within the userâ€™s AppData directory, suggesting its intent to establish persistence or additional payload delivery mechanisms. From a network perspective, it generates UDP traffic to multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for discovery or data exfiltration activities. These combined characteristics underline the malware's focus on stealth, adaptability, and control.
