The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis of the provided malware sample reveals significant behavioral and network activity indicative of malicious intent. The sample exhibits advanced tactics such as process injection, creating and manipulating remote threads, and writing executables to sensitive locations like the AppData directory. The malware also demonstrates an interest in antivirus detection by probing registry keys for Chinese AV products and other security software. Additionally, it engages in stealth by deleting its executed files after use. Network analysis highlights UDP traffic targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or reconnaissance. Functionally, the malware demonstrates capabilities for persistence and evasion, with actions like DLL loading, registry modifications, and writing to sensitive directories. These behaviors suggest the sample is engineered for system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment. The network and functional indicators warrant immediate remediation and further investigation.
