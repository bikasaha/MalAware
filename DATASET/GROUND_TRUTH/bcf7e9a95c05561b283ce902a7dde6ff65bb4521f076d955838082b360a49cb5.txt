The behavioral and network analysis of the provided malware sample reveals significant indicators of malicious activity. The malware employs anti-analysis techniques, including attempts to detect human interaction through foreground window changes and delaying execution with sleep commands. It allocates executable memory dynamically, suggesting self-unpacking capabilities, and creates hidden and executable files, indicative of persistence and stealth. Functional intelligence highlights its ability to establish persistence through autorun entries and execute dropped binaries, including those in user-accessible directories like AppData. The high entropy in the PE sections suggests the use of packers or encryption to obscure its payload. Network analysis shows consistent UDP traffic to multicast addresses, potentially signaling discovery or data exfiltration attempts. These activities collectively indicate a sophisticated malware variant with anti-analysis, persistence, and possible network reconnaissance or data exfiltration capabilities.
