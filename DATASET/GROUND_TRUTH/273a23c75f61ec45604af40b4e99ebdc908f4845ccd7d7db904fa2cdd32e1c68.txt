The analyzed malware sample demonstrates sophisticated behavioral and network patterns, along with functional characteristics indicative of its intent. Behaviorally, the sample exhibits persistence mechanisms by registering itself for autorun at system startup and modifying registry keys related to Windows proxy settings, enabling traffic interception and potential data exfiltration. Functionally, the malware loads various system-critical DLLs and interacts with the Windows registry, indicating a deep system integration aimed at stealth and control. Network analysis reveals multiple UDP communications with local broadcast addresses and multicasting protocols, hinting at reconnaissance or command-and-control activities. The use of multiple user agents in network traffic underscores its ability to mimic legitimate processes to evade detection. Overall, the malware combines persistence, obfuscation, and network manipulation techniques to achieve its objectives, presenting significant challenges for detection and mitigation in infected systems.
