The malware exhibits sophisticated behavioral traits, including memory manipulation and persistence mechanisms. It frequently allocates and modifies memory permissions to execute dynamically, as observed through calls to APIs like NtProtectVirtualMemory with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions, indicating potential unpacking or injection activities. The creation and execution of files in the AppData directory (msieckc.exe) reflect dropper behavior and persistence strategies, including setting autorun keys in the registry. Additionally, anti-virtualization techniques are evident from checks on virtual network adapters and CPU registry keys. Network analysis reveals UDP traffic targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, possibly for lateral movement or reconnaissance, and connections to suspicious domains, such as automachine.servequake.com. Functionally, the malware adapts by modifying Windows Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) settings to potentially intercept network traffic, demonstrating its capability to manipulate local system configurations for malicious purposes. This blend of evasion, persistence, and functional intelligence underscores its advanced design for stealth and resilience.
