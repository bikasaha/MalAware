The analysis of the provided malware sample reveals several behavioral, network, and functional characteristics indicative of malicious activity. Behaviorally, the sample employs anti-sandbox techniques such as delaying execution (msmsgr.exe sleep) and probing virtual network interfaces, hindering dynamic analysis. It also persists on the system by setting autorun registry keys and modifies proxy settings for potential traffic interception. Additionally, it reads and writes registry keys extensively and interacts with system DLLs, suggesting system-level intrusion attempts. Network-wise, the malware engages in UDP communications, primarily targeting multicast addresses, potentially for command-and-control (C2) or reconnaissance purposes, and uses multiple user agents, possibly to disguise network traffic. Functionally, it exhibits signs of localization (Chinese language resources) and privilege escalation attempts (SeDebugPrivilege). These findings, combined with its attempts to fetch URLs and manipulate system configurations, highlight a sophisticated approach to maintain stealth and maximize impact, indicating its use in targeted campaigns.
