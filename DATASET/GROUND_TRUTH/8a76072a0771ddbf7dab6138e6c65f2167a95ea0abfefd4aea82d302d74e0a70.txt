The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals significant behavioral and network characteristics of the analyzed malware, with a high score of 8.4 indicating malicious intent. Behavioral analysis highlights multiple techniques aimed at persistence, evasion, and process injection. The malware creates and drops executables (e.g., igfxext.exe) in the AppData directory, modifies registry keys for autorun at startup, and delays execution to evade sandbox detection (antisandbox_sleep). Advanced evasion techniques include anti-virtualization checks on CPU and network adapters and injecting code into remote processes using methods like WriteProcessMemory and NtSetContextThread. Network analysis shows the malwareâ€™s use of UDP traffic to multicast addresses (224.0.0.252) and potential DNS exploitation, though no HTTP or ICMP communication was observed in this instance. Functional intelligence reveals its capability to modify proxy settings (WPAD) for traffic redirection and establish connections to potentially malicious domains (e.g., greenlabelstud.000space.com). Overall, the malware employs sophisticated persistence, injection, and evasion techniques that underscore its high-risk profile.
