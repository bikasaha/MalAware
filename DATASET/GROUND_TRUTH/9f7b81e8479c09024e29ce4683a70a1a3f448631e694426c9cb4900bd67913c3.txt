The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis highlights several key behavioral, network, and functional aspects of the malware. Behaviorally, the sample demonstrates characteristics of a dropper, including the creation of executable files (msieckc.exe) in user directories like AppData, which is consistent with attempts to maintain persistence and evade detection. Additionally, the malware modifies registry keys for autorun at startup and employs virtual memory allocation techniques such as NtProtectVirtualMemory and NtAllocateVirtualMemory with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions, indicating potential unpacking or in-memory code execution. The sample also interacts with DLLs and system resources, suggesting an effort to integrate with the operating system environment.

Network analysis reveals UDP-based communication targeting multicast and broadcast addresses (224.0.0.252 and 192.168.56.255), which could signify reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts. The malware also resolves suspicious hostnames (wowhome.byethost8.com and bokselpa.dasfree.com), suggesting potential Command and Control (C&C) communication. No direct HTTP or DNS interactions were logged, possibly indicating evasion tactics or reliance on alternative protocols.

Functionally, the malware demonstrates anti-VM capabilities by inspecting network adapters to detect virtualized environments. It also manipulates WPAD proxy settings, likely aiming to intercept or redirect network traffic for malicious purposes. With a moderate score of 3.4, the malware exhibits persistence, stealth, and functional capabilities typical of advanced threats.
