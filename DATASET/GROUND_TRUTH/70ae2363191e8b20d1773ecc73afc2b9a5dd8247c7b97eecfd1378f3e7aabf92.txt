The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals significant behavioral and network insights into the submitted malware sample. Behaviorally, the malware demonstrates anti-sandbox techniques, such as extended sleep calls and virtualization checks via BIOS and SCSI identifiers, to evade detection. It allocates executable memory to unpack itself, creates hidden processes, and modifies the system by writing executable files to sensitive locations like the userâ€™s AppData folder. The malware employs Windows utilities and performs system reconnaissance through registry and WMI queries. Network-wise, it generates UDP traffic to multicast addresses and employs various source ports, potentially for data exfiltration or lateral movement. Functionally, the malware shows sophistication by dynamically loading libraries, creating mutexes for process synchronization, and interacting with command-line utilities to terminate and delete processes, reflecting advanced persistence and evasion tactics. These behaviors indicate a likely targeted and stealthy attack aiming to evade detection while maintaining control over the infected system.
