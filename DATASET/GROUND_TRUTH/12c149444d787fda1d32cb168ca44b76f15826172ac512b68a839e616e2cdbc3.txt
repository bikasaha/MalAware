The analyzed malware exhibits sophisticated behavioral patterns and network activities, emphasizing process injection and memory manipulation. Behavioral analysis reveals the malware allocates executable memory regions and performs process injection using APIs such as NtSetContextThread and NtResumeThread, indicating techniques like RunPE, often used for evading detection. The presence of high entropy in packed sections suggests the use of compression or encryption to obfuscate its payload. Functionally, it manipulates .NET Framework resources and loads multiple DLLs, demonstrating capabilities to execute and manipulate processes across various environments. Network activity includes UDP traffic targeting broadcast and multicast addresses, which may signify reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts within a local network. These findings collectively indicate an advanced threat aimed at stealthy execution and potential network propagation.
