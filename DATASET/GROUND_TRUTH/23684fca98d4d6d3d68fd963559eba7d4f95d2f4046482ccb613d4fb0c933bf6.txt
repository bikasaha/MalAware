The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals significant behavioral, network, and functional intelligence about the analyzed malware. Behaviorally, the sample exhibits several anti-sandbox and anti-virtualization techniques, including foreground window checks and sleep delays to evade detection, and VMware detection. It creates, hides, and deletes executables (e.g., E455.tmp), modifies system autorun settings, and loads multiple DLLs to manipulate the environment. The malware achieves persistence by dropping executables into the AppData folder and creating hidden files like BluetoothPairingService.job. It also displays characteristics of a dropper by writing and executing binaries.

From a network perspective, the sample shows UDP activity with broadcasts to local and multicast addresses (e.g., 224.0.0.252), targeting ports like 5355 and 137, which are indicative of network enumeration or service discovery. However, no HTTP or DNS requests were observed in this session.

Functionally, the malware contains packed sections with high entropy, suggesting encrypted or obfuscated payloads, and performs registry modifications to monitor or alter user settings. Its operational focus appears to align with data exfiltration and system compromise, leveraging stealth and persistence mechanisms to maintain control over the infected environment.
