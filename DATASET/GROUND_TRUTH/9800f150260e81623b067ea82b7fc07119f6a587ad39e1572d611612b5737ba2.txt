The behavioral analysis of the provided Cuckoo Sandbox report indicates that the malware exhibits several sophisticated techniques to evade detection and establish persistence. The program delays analysis using an extended sleep function and actively scans running processes to identify targets for sandbox evasion or code injection. It also checks for system privileges like SeDebugPrivilege to assess its operational environment. Persistence mechanisms are evident through the installation of an autorun registry key (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\...\Run\WarKing) for execution on startup. Additionally, it creates and manipulates executable files, including DaumCleans.exe, in the filesystem.

The network analysis reveals active communication over UDP with broadcast and multicast addresses (224.0.0.252, 239.255.255.250), suggesting potential reconnaissance or data exfiltration activities. Despite no HTTP or DNS requests, the targeted IP addresses and use of ephemeral ports underscore its effort to blend within legitimate traffic. Functional intelligence highlights its use of critical Windows APIs for process manipulation, registry key interactions, and file operations, emphasizing its capability for espionage, sabotage, or persistence in compromised systems.

These findings underscore the malware's intent to conceal its activities, maintain persistence, and exploit system privileges, posing a significant threat in operational environments.
