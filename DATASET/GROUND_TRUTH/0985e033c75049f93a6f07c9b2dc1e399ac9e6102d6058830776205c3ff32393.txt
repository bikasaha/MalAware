The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals a moderately suspicious executable (ae004a5d4f1829594d830956c55d6ae4) with a behavioral score of 5.6. The malware demonstrates various malicious traits, including allocating executable memory (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE), a common tactic for self-unpacking. It delays analysis using anti-sandbox sleep calls and manipulates registry keys to configure proxies for traffic interception, indicative of network traffic manipulation capabilities. Network analysis highlights UDP communication to multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or reconnaissance. Functional intelligence indicates that the malware drops and executes additional binaries, creates office documents, and accesses numerous system files and registry keys, suggesting information theft or further payload deployment. It also employs anti-virtualization techniques by querying network adapter properties. The indicators of compromise (IoCs) and observed persistence mechanisms underscore its stealthy and resilient nature, targeting the victim's system for extended operations.
