The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals that the examined malware is a browser infostealer, primarily targeting sensitive information stored in web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Behavioral analysis highlights that the malware engages in file manipulation, including creating and copying browser login data, and interacts heavily with the Windows registry to access browser configuration keys. Network activity shows extensive UDP traffic directed towards multicast and broadcast addresses, indicative of potential reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts. Functional intelligence underscores the malware's ability to extract login credentials and browser-specific information, posing significant risks to user privacy and data security. This analysis suggests a highly targeted, stealthy attack designed to compromise local browsers and potentially propagate within a network.
