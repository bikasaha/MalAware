The malware exhibits advanced evasion and persistence capabilities, with a behavior score of 8.8 indicating high risk. Behavioral analysis reveals anti-sandbox techniques, such as intentional delays (antisandbox_sleep) and checks for virtualization environments (antivm_generic_cpu), alongside process injection methods (injection_ntsetcontextthread) and attempts to resume suspended threads (injection_resumethread). The malware creates executables in the userâ€™s AppData directory, demonstrating persistence by adding autorun registry keys. Network analysis shows multiple UDP communications targeting multicast addresses and a suspected attempt to resolve external hosts (redlooksman.servehttp.com and others), indicating potential C&C activity or data exfiltration preparation. Functional intelligence highlights its capability to manipulate system proxy settings (modifies_proxy_wpad) and inject payloads into processes for execution, revealing its sophisticated nature. Overall, the malware is designed for stealth, persistence, and potential exploitation of infected systems.
