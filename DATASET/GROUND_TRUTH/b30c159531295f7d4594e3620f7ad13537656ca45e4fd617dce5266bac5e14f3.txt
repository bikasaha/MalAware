The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals that the malware demonstrates sophisticated behavior through dynamic memory allocation and protection changes, indicating potential unpacking and self-modification. Behavioral intelligence highlights the frequent use of system libraries such as user32.dll, kernel32.dll, and ntdll.dll, suggesting the malware interacts heavily with core Windows functions, potentially for persistence or privilege escalation. Network analysis shows significant UDP activity, including multicast traffic to 224.0.0.252 and communication on ports indicative of service discovery and potential reconnaissance. High entropy sections in the executable, particularly in .text and .sedata, signal the presence of encrypted or packed data, often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. Functional intelligence suggests capabilities such as anti-analysis measures (e.g., stack bypass) and heavy use of memory protection APIs (NtProtectVirtualMemory), indicative of evasive and stealthy behavior aimed at bypassing traditional defenses.
