The malware exhibits sophisticated evasion, persistence, and stealth techniques based on behavioral and network analysis. Behavioral indicators reveal memory manipulation (e.g., RWX allocation for self-unpacking), sandbox detection through sleep delays and foreground window checks, and the creation of hidden files and autorun entries for persistence. Additionally, the malware drops executable files in sensitive directories such as the AppData folder and executes them while deleting traces post-execution. Network analysis shows frequent UDP communication, including local subnet and multicast addresses, which could indicate lateral movement or information exfiltration. Functionally, the malware demonstrates characteristics of a dropper, delivering payloads and leveraging high entropy in packed sections to evade static analysis. The report identifies API usage, such as NtCreateFile and CreateProcessInternalW, tied to file and process manipulation. This operational profile underscores the malwareâ€™s capability to remain undetected while compromising host integrity and facilitating further malicious activity.
