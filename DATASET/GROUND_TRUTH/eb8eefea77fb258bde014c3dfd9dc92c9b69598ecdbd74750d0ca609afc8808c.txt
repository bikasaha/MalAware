The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis of the submitted sample reveals significant behavioral and network anomalies indicative of malware activity. The malware exhibits behaviors such as allocating executable memory, unpacking itself, and creating temporary executable files in sensitive directories like AppData and SysWOW64. It manipulates the registry for network configurations and proxy settings, which can facilitate traffic interception or network persistence. Anti-sandbox techniques, such as delaying execution and checking for virtual network adapters, were observed, indicating attempts to evade detection. High entropy in the PE file's .rsrc section suggests the presence of packed or encrypted data.

Network analysis indicates repeated UDP traffic targeting multicast addresses, which may be part of reconnaissance or command-and-control (C2) communication attempts. Additionally, the malware resolves and connects to suspicious domains (codec.servepics.com and sales.eu5.org), further supporting its potential for remote communication or data exfiltration. Functionally, the malware interacts with various critical DLLs (kernel32.dll, user32.dll) and performs file operations to replicate and disguise its presence, aligning with typical persistence mechanisms. These behaviors underscore the malware's multi-faceted design for persistence, stealth, and potential exploitation.
