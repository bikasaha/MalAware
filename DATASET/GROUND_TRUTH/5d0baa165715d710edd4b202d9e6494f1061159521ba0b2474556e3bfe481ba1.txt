The analyzed malware exhibits advanced persistence, anti-analysis, and injection techniques. It creates autorun entries and services for persistence, moves its executable to a system directory, and allocates executable memory, indicating self-unpacking. Anti-sandbox tactics include delaying execution and monitoring user activity to detect analysis environments. The malware modifies and writes memory into other processes, signaling potential code injection. Behavioral analysis shows it interacts with numerous registry keys, system directories, and processes while leveraging packed sections, as evidenced by high entropy. Network analysis reveals repeated UDP traffic to multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially probing or exfiltrating data. Functionally, the malware's tactics align with stealthy delivery and system compromise, necessitating stringent monitoring and proactive defenses.
