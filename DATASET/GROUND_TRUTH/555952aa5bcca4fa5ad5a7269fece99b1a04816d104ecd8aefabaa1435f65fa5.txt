The analysis of the provided malware report reveals significant behavioral, network, and functional intelligence. Behavioral analysis indicates that the malware employs sophisticated tactics for persistence and evasion, such as allocating read-write-execute memory, creating services for autorun at system startup, and deleting executed files to cover its tracks. Additionally, it manipulates Windows APIs (e.g., NtProtectVirtualMemory and NtAllocateVirtualMemory) to unpack itself in memory and utilizes techniques like dropping executable files in system-critical directories and creating mutexes to maintain control. The malware demonstrates potential connections to the PlugX RAT family, indicated by specific file and registry artifacts. Network analysis highlights UDP communication targeting local multicast addresses and DNS-related ports, suggesting potential data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) activities. The functional intelligence underscores its focus on privilege escalation (e.g., checking for SeDebugPrivilege), process manipulation, and stealth techniques. Overall, the malware shows signs of being a dropper that executes and conceals secondary payloads while leveraging system resources for stealth and persistence.
