The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals notable behavioral, network, and functional characteristics of the analyzed malware. Behaviorally, the malware allocates read-write-execute (RWX) memory, often indicative of unpacking or self-modifying code, and interacts heavily with system resources, including numerous registry key operations, DLL loads, and API calls such as NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory. The high entropy in the .text section of the executable suggests the use of a packer, which is commonly employed to obfuscate malicious payloads. From a network perspective, the malware exhibits communication patterns using UDP, targeting multicast and broadcast addresses (224.0.0.252 and 192.168.56.255), likely for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functionally, the malware appears to exploit the .NET framework environment, interacting with native images and system libraries, which hints at its reliance on .NET-based obfuscation or execution. These findings collectively indicate that the malware is equipped for stealth, obfuscation, and potentially modular capabilities for further malicious actions.
