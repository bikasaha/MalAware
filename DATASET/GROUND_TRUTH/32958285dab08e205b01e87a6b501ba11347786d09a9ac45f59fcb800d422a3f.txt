The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals that the analyzed executable (532013750ee3caac93a9972103761233) exhibits suspicious behavior and potential anti-sandbox techniques. Behavioral analysis indicates that the malware allocates significant read-write-execute memory regions, suggesting unpacking or self-modification to evade detection. It also delays the analysis environment with exaggerated sleep calls, a common anti-sandbox tactic. Registry manipulation, DLL loading, and failed attempts to access configuration files further demonstrate its intrusive and stealthy nature. Network analysis highlights unusual UDP activity, including multiple communications to multicast addresses (224.0.0.252 and 239.255.255.250), which could signify reconnaissance or command-and-control (C&C) communications. Functional intelligence points to the malware's .NET assembly nature and its ability to interact with system-level APIs, potentially indicating it targets specific environments using tailored payloads. These findings underscore the executable's malicious intent and the need for mitigation strategies focused on memory analysis and network anomaly detection.
