The analyzed malware exhibits notable behavior and network activity indicative of evasion, persistence, and potential data exfiltration capabilities. Behaviorally, the sample leverages sandbox evasion techniques by introducing significant delays through sleep functions and examines running processes to detect sandbox environments or inject malicious code. It modifies registry entries to establish persistence, creating autorun keys in the Windows registry. Additionally, it creates multiple executable files and interacts extensively with registry and system API calls, particularly focusing on privilege escalation attempts via the "SeDebugPrivilege" mechanism.

Network analysis reveals frequent UDP communication, predominantly targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, which could facilitate lateral movement or command-and-control (C2) activities. Although no HTTP or DNS queries were observed, the malware resolves several suspicious domains, further implicating its potential for external communication. Functional intelligence highlights its reliance on mutex creation and DLL injection to maintain control and evade detection. Overall, the malware's combination of evasion, persistence, and network manipulation underscores its sophisticated design and adaptability for malicious purposes.
