The analysis of the Cuckoo Sandbox malware report reveals several critical insights into its behavior, network activity, and functional intelligence. Behavioral analysis highlights malicious activities such as memory allocations with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions, indicative of code injection or unpacking mechanisms, the creation and deletion of suspicious executable files (e.g., vmount.bat), and attempts to modify sensitive registry keys (e.g., HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\Display\Image\Pixel). The malware also exhibits stealth by creating hidden windows and utilizing high-entropy packed sections, suggesting evasion and obfuscation tactics. Network analysis detected UDP traffic to multicast and broadcast addresses (e.g., 224.0.0.252) over ports such as 5355, commonly associated with LLMNR/DNS activity, potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional intelligence shows the malware acting as a dropper, executing and deleting its payloads, and disabling key services (e.g., spooler) to disrupt system defenses. Additionally, API calls like Process32NextW suggest enumeration attempts for process injection or monitoring. These behaviors collectively indicate advanced evasion, persistence, and propagation strategies employed by the malware.
