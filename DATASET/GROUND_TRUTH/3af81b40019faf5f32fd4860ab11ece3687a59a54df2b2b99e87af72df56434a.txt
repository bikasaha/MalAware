The behavioral analysis of the malware identified through the Cuckoo Sandbox reveals various anti-analysis techniques, including sleep delays, checks for virtual machine environments, and attempts to evade sandbox detection by querying adapter addresses and registry keys. The malware engages in process injection techniques, notably using NtSetContextThread and WriteProcessMemory, suggesting malicious payload delivery into other processes. It also modifies WPAD proxy settings, potentially to intercept and redirect network traffic. Network analysis shows consistent UDP communication with multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially signaling reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts. Functionally, the malware exhibits code injection and persistence mechanisms by creating registry entries and manipulating system files, indicating a strong capability for espionage and potential further exploitation. Overall, the sample demonstrates sophisticated behaviors aimed at persistence, evasion, and network-level activity.
