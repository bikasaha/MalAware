The analysis of the malware file cf5e472613921dc330008c79870b23ab.exe reveals significant behavioral and network activity indicative of malicious intent. Behaviorally, the malware allocates read-write-execute memory, likely for unpacking or injecting code, and employs anti-sandbox techniques, such as querying idle system time and introducing significant delays to hinder automated analysis. It achieves persistence by creating autorun entries in the registry and replicates itself to startup folders. Functionally, the malware interacts with multiple system APIs to manipulate virtual memory and load libraries, showcasing potential for sophisticated payload execution. From a network perspective, it generates high UDP traffic, primarily broadcasting to multicast addresses and ports such as 5355 and 1900, possibly for reconnaissance or command-and-control (C2) communication. These behaviors, coupled with its ability to bypass protections and embed itself deeply within the system, highlight its potential as a multi-stage threat.
