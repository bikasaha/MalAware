The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals the malicious file exhibits multiple behavioral and network indicators typical of advanced persistence and stealth tactics. Behavioral analysis indicates the malware uses anti-sandbox techniques such as checking for human activity and delaying execution (NtDelayExecution) to evade detection. It creates hidden files (ScheduledDefrag.job) and executable files in sensitive locations, drops and executes binaries (defrag.exe), and demonstrates persistence through autorun installations. The malware deletes evidence of its executed files and exhibits characteristics of a packer with high entropy, suggesting potential obfuscation.

Network analysis highlights UDP activity across various ports, predominantly targeting multicast and broadcast addresses (5355, 1900), likely indicating reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts. The absence of HTTP or DNS communication suggests a focus on local network exploitation rather than external command-and-control communication.

From a functional intelligence perspective, the malware manipulates the Windows registry, creates processes with hidden windows, and leverages high-privilege APIs, showcasing a clear intent for persistence, stealth, and system compromise. Its use of virtual machine detection further aligns with targeting analysis environments, indicating sophistication in evasion strategies.
