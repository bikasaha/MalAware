The analysis of the malware report generated by Cuckoo Sandbox highlights suspicious behavior, significant network activity, and potential functionality indicating malicious intent. Behaviorally, the sample allocates read-write-execute memory multiple times, suggesting self-unpacking capabilities, and checks for privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, indicating potential system-level manipulation. It also interacts heavily with system APIs like NtAllocateVirtualMemory, LdrGetProcedureAddress, and NtQueryValueKey, reflecting its reliance on Windows APIs for execution and persistence. From a network perspective, it sends frequent UDP packets to broadcast and multicast addresses, which could signify reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts in a network. Functionally, the high entropy in its .text section suggests the presence of packed or encrypted payloads, making static analysis challenging. These indicators collectively imply advanced evasion techniques and potential use in targeted attacks, underscoring the importance of detailed investigation and containment.
