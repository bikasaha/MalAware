The analyzed malware exhibits behaviors indicative of persistence, evasion, and potential data exfiltration. Behavioral analysis reveals that the sample allocates read-write-execute memory multiple times, likely for unpacking itself, and creates executable files such as winnet32.exe, a known indicator of compromise, within the user's AppData directory. The malware establishes persistence by modifying registry keys for autorun on system startup. Network analysis identifies attempts to resolve and connect to hosts such as checkingvirusscan.com and communicate over UDP to multicast and broadcast addresses, which could indicate reconnaissance or command-and-control activities. Functionally, the malware attempts to bypass virtual environment detection by inspecting network adapters, modifies proxy settings for traffic interception, and demonstrates anti-debugging techniques. These findings highlight its capability to maintain a foothold on the system, evade detection, and potentially intercept and exfiltrate sensitive data.
