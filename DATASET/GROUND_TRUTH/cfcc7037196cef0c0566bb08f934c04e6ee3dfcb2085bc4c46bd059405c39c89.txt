The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals significant behavioral and network indicators of malicious activity. Behaviorally, the malware exhibits anti-analysis tactics such as delaying execution through NtDelayExecution and employing virtualization checks (e.g., querying virtual network adapters and registry keys for CPU details). It creates and executes files in the userâ€™s AppData folder (igfxext.exe), modifies registry keys for persistence, and performs process injection techniques (e.g., NtSetContextThread, WriteProcessMemory). Functional intelligence identifies the malware as a dropper capable of downloading additional payloads and potentially intercepting traffic through WPAD proxy manipulation. Network analysis shows UDP communication, including connections to multicast and broadcast addresses, suggesting possible discovery or exfiltration activities. The malware's functionality, combined with its stealth techniques, indicates a high risk (score: 8.4) and emphasizes the need for robust detection mechanisms.
