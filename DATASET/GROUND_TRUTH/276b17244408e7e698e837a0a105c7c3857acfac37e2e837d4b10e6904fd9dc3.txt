The malware exhibits advanced behavioral and network characteristics, indicating potential threat sophistication. Behavioral analysis reveals the malware engages in process injection, memory manipulation, and remote thread creation, pointing to stealthy execution tactics. It creates multiple executables and registry keys for persistence, notably targeting the AppData directory and startup configurations. Anti-analysis techniques are evident, including checks for antivirus registry keys and virtual environment detection. Network analysis indicates UDP communication, predominantly directed to multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or command-and-control signaling. Functional intelligence highlights its ability to delete traces post-execution, dynamically modify memory, and load libraries, suggesting capabilities for espionage or data exfiltration. These combined behaviors classify it as a high-severity threat requiring immediate containment and analysis.
