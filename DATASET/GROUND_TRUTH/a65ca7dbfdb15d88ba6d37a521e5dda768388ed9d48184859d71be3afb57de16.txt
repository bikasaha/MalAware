The analysis of the malware from the Cuckoo Sandbox highlights a range of malicious activities. Behavioral Analysis reveals the malware employs sandbox evasion techniques such as delaying execution for 338 seconds (antisandbox_sleep) and scanning for processes to identify potential injection targets (injection_process_search). It also establishes persistence by creating autorun registry entries and modifying system proxies to intercept network traffic. The executable creates and deletes files in the AppData folder, demonstrating stealthy file manipulation.

Network Analysis shows the malware engages in UDP communication, broadcasting to multicast addresses and connecting to external hosts like task.dns-syn.com. These connections indicate potential command-and-control (C2) activity or reconnaissance.

Functional Intelligence indicates the malware attempts to evade detection by checking for virtualized environments (antivm_network_adapters) and querying privileges (SeDebugPrivilege). It alters Windows Proxy Auto-Detection (WPAD) settings, enabling traffic redirection and enhancing its capability for surveillance and exfiltration. The behavior, combined with persistence mechanisms and evasion strategies, underscores its sophistication and adaptability in bypassing defensive measures.
