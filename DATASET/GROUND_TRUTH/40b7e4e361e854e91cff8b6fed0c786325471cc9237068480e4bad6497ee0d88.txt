The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals a moderately malicious file (score: 4.0) characterized by several suspicious behaviors and network activities. Behaviorally, the malware exhibits advanced techniques such as memory allocation with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions, indicative of unpacking or self-modifying code, and process injection using NtSetContextThread and NtResumeThread APIs to manipulate threads in remote processes. It also demonstrates high entropy in certain sections, consistent with the presence of packed or encrypted data, and extensive registry and file access activities. The executable dynamically loads numerous libraries, including .NET framework DLLs, suggesting dependency on managed code environments. Network-wise, it generates UDP traffic targeting broadcast and multicast addresses, potentially attempting local network reconnaissance or service discovery. The lack of HTTP or DNS traffic implies that the analyzed stage may not include command-and-control communication. Functional intelligence identifies the file as a PE32 executable for Windows, with its activity suggesting attempts to evade detection through injection, memory manipulation, and code obfuscation. The findings highlight its potential role in deploying a secondary payload or performing reconnaissance within a compromised environment.
