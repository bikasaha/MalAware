The malware exhibited sophisticated evasion and persistence techniques, along with functional capabilities indicative of a targeted attack. Behavioral analysis revealed anti-sandbox tactics such as sleep delays (281 seconds) and anti-virtualization checks through adapter addresses and CPU registry keys. Persistence was achieved by installing an autorun entry in the Windows registry for repeated execution upon startup. Functionally, the malware created and deleted executable files in the AppData directory, suggesting transient activity to avoid detection. Network analysis highlighted suspicious UDP communication to multicast and broadcast addresses, hinting at possible reconnaissance or command-and-control signaling. The malware also manipulated proxy settings via the WPAD registry to intercept or redirect traffic. These behaviors collectively indicate advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) aligning with stealthy threat actor methodologies, warranting immediate mitigation and further forensic investigation.
