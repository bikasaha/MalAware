The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis of the provided malware sample reveals significant behavioral, network, and functional intelligence indicators. Behaviorally, the malware exhibits anti-sandbox techniques, such as delaying analysis by sleeping for 299 seconds, indicative of attempts to evade detection. It creates, writes, and deletes files, such as `DaumCleans.exe`, manipulates registry keys, and loads DLLs like `kernel32.dll`, suggesting installation and execution phases. The use of high-entropy sections hints at packing or encryption to obfuscate code. Functionally, the malware accesses privileged system API calls like `LookupPrivilegeValueW` to check for `SeDebugPrivilege`, a sign of potential system control escalation. Network activity includes multiple UDP connections to multicast addresses, which could facilitate lateral movement or data exfiltration. Furthermore, the presence of Chinese language resources in the PE file and connections to suspicious domains (e.g., `war.winxps.com`) implies its potential origin or intended targets. These characteristics underline the malware's sophistication in evasion, persistence, and potential exploitation capabilities.
