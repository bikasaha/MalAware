The malware analyzed via the Cuckoo Sandbox exhibits behavior indicative of advanced persistence and obfuscation techniques. Behavioral analysis reveals significant memory manipulation activities, such as the allocation and protection of read-write-execute (RWX) memory regions, typically associated with unpacking and executing malicious payloads. The binary also demonstrates high entropy, suggesting the presence of packed or encrypted data, a hallmark of evasion tactics. Key API calls include frequent usage of NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory, signaling efforts to bypass memory protections. Network analysis shows UDP traffic originating from the infected host, targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or exfiltration reconnaissance. Notably, destination ports include 5355 (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution), hinting at network probing or service abuse. Functional intelligence highlights the binary as a .NET assembly with dependencies on various Windows system libraries, indicative of a potentially multi-staged attack leveraging legitimate runtime environments for stealth. Combined, these characteristics suggest the malware is engineered for persistence, stealth, and potential lateral movement within target environments.
