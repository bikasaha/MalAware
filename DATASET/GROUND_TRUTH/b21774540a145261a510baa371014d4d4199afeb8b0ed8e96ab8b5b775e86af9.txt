The behavioral and network analysis of the malware indicates sophisticated evasion and persistence techniques. The malware exhibits anti-sandbox behaviors, such as checking for human activity through window focus changes and delaying analysis by invoking sleep functions. It allocates read-write-execute memory, suggesting potential unpacking of payloads, and creates executables and hidden files, including persistent jobs for autorun at system startup. Furthermore, it drops and executes binaries, deletes evidence, and utilizes high-entropy data sections, characteristic of packed or encrypted payloads.

Network analysis shows UDP traffic to multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for discovery or lateral movement within the network. Functional intelligence highlights the creation and execution of malicious files in critical directories like AppData and Temp, along with modification of registry keys and file attributes to maintain stealth and persistence. These behaviors collectively point toward malware engineered for stealth, persistence, and potential lateral movement, necessitating robust endpoint and network defenses.
