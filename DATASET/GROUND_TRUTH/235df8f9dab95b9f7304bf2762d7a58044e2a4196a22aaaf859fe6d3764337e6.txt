The malware analyzed via Cuckoo Sandbox exhibits behavior indicative of persistence and potential reconnaissance activities. The behavioral analysis reveals that the sample uses Windows utilities, including registry manipulation (reg.exe), to achieve persistence by adding an autorun entry in the registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\...\Run\dumpsave) for execution at startup. This highlights a method for maintaining access to the infected system. The sample frequently interacts with various registry keys, reads and writes registry entries, and enumerates directories, suggesting reconnaissance or preparatory actions for further operations.

The network analysis shows notable UDP traffic, with communication patterns targeting multicast addresses (224.0.0.252, 239.255.255.250) and services such as port 5355 (LLMNR) and port 1900 (UPnP), indicating potential lateral movement or discovery attempts. However, no HTTP or DNS traffic was recorded, reducing the likelihood of immediate command-and-control (C2) communication during the observed execution window.

Functionally, the malware's reliance on Windows utilities, such as cmd.exe and registry tools, and its stealthy operations via DLL injection (kernel32.dll) suggest an approach focused on blending in with legitimate system processes to evade detection. Overall, the sample demonstrates persistence and local network reconnaissance capabilities, with a low score of 1.2 indicating minimal overt malicious activity during this analysis. Further investigations into file activities and dynamic behavior in different environments are recommended.
