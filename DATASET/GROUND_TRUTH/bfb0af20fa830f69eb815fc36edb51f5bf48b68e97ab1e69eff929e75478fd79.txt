The malware analyzed exhibits advanced evasion techniques and persistence mechanisms. Behavioral analysis reveals the use of anti-sandbox tactics, including delaying execution (NtDelayExecution) and monitoring user activity via foreground window changes. The sample created hidden and system files, dropped executables in user directories (AppData), and leveraged auto-run registry keys for persistence. Notably, it included capabilities to delete executed files, indicating efforts to obscure its tracks post-execution.

Network analysis highlighted UDP traffic targeting multicast addresses and NetBIOS name services, which could signify reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts within a network. No significant HTTP, DNS, or ICMP activity was observed, suggesting the malware may use unconventional protocols for communication or data exfiltration.

Functional intelligence points to the malware's likely packed nature, as evidenced by high entropy in its .text and .data sections, which often signify encrypted or compressed data. The sample's functionality as a dropper and its modifications to critical system directories and registries underscore its intent for prolonged stealth and control. Overall, the malware demonstrates capabilities aligned with sophisticated threat actors, prioritizing stealth, persistence, and potential lateral movement.
