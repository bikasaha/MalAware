The behavioral and network analysis of the provided Cuckoo Sandbox report reveals a potentially malicious executable with sophisticated capabilities for persistence, execution, and evasion. The malware allocates read-write-execute memory to unpack itself and drops a binary to the userâ€™s AppData folder (msieckc.exe), indicating its self-extraction and persistence. It modifies registry keys, including autorun settings, to maintain persistence upon system startup. Furthermore, it attempts to bypass virtual machine detection by checking for virtual network interfaces and manipulates WPAD proxy settings to intercept traffic.

From a network perspective, the malware makes several UDP communications, including multicast traffic (224.0.0.252) to port 5355, suggesting potential lateral movement or network reconnaissance. It also connects to suspicious hosts like wwvv.serveblog.net and wwvv.strangled.net, hinting at command-and-control (C&C) communications. Functional intelligence indicates that the malware interacts extensively with the Windows API for registry manipulation, process injection, and file operations, demonstrating a focus on system compromise and network exploitation.
