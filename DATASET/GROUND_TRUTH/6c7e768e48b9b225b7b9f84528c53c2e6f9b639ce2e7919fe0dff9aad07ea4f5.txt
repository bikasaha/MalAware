The malware sample exhibits sophisticated behaviors indicative of advanced evasion and persistence techniques. Behavioral analysis highlights the allocation of executable memory for potential unpacking and self-modification, the creation and execution of scripts and binaries in the AppData folder, and the deletion of its traces post-execution. Notable is the detection of anti-virtual machine techniques, including probing for VirtualBox artifacts, suggesting efforts to evade analysis in sandboxed environments. Additionally, the malware creates hidden processes to obfuscate its activities.

Network analysis shows the malware generating frequent UDP traffic, with connections to multicast and broadcast addresses, which may indicate scanning, command-and-control, or lateral movement activities. The absence of HTTP and ICMP traffic suggests a focus on stealth or non-standard communication protocols.

From a functional intelligence perspective, the malwareâ€™s primary operations involve dropping executables, executing them with obfuscated commands, and utilizing DLLs associated with network and cryptographic functionalities. This aligns with goals of data exfiltration, persistence, or reconnaissance. The severity of behaviors observed underscores its capability to execute targeted and resilient attacks.
