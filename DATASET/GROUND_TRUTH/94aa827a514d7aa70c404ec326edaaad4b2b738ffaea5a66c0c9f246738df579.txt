The malware analyzed in the provided Cuckoo Sandbox report exhibits several behavioral and network-based characteristics typical of advanced threats. Behaviorally, it demonstrates process injection capabilities by manipulating and writing to the memory of other processes, as well as allocating read-write-execute (RWX) memory, indicative of unpacking or code injection. Anti-analysis techniques are evident, including checking for human activity and delaying analysis using sleep functions. Functionally, the malware acts as a potential infostealer with keylogging capabilities by installing keyboard hooks, and it utilizes process rundll32.exe to load malicious DLLs. The network analysis highlights extensive UDP traffic targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, which might be reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts. Overall, the malware combines evasive, data-stealing, and potentially network-exploiting features, signaling a threat aimed at persistence, data exfiltration, or further compromise.
