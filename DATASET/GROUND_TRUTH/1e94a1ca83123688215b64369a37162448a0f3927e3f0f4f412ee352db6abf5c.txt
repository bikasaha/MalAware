The analysis of the malware provided by the Cuckoo Sandbox reveals advanced anti-analysis and stealth techniques alongside suspicious behaviors indicative of malicious intent. The behavioral analysis shows that the malware uses sandbox-evasion strategies, such as detecting the foreground window to simulate user activity, querying disk sizes to detect virtual environments, and employing sleep delays to hinder automated analysis. It also demonstrates capability to monitor user input through mouse hooks and keylogging. The creation of hidden windows and the execution of Windows utilities like taskkill.exe further underline its malicious functionality. Network analysis indicates the use of multiple UDP communication attempts, often broadcasting to multicast addresses (224.0.0.252), which could signify reconnaissance or exfiltration activities. Additionally, functional intelligence reveals the creation and modification of numerous files and registry keys, potentially for persistence and system compromise. Together, these findings indicate a sophisticated malware sample with capabilities for evasion, data theft, and system manipulation.
