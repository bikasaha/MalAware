The malware analyzed by Cuckoo Sandbox demonstrates advanced capabilities indicative of sophisticated behavior. The behavioral analysis reveals extensive use of API calls such as NtProtectVirtualMemory and NtAllocateVirtualMemory, indicating unpacking and memory protection modifications. The malware delays analysis using sleep functions and interacts with the registry to modify settings, including WPAD proxy configurations, which could facilitate network traffic interception. The network analysis identifies multiple UDP communications targeting local broadcast and multicast addresses, possibly for reconnaissance or C2 communication. Additionally, DNS and HTTP requests to suspicious domains (codec.servepics.com and sales.eu5.org) were observed, hinting at potential exfiltration or control mechanisms. Functional intelligence highlights high entropy in binary sections, suggesting encryption or compression indicative of packed malware, and file manipulations in critical directories (SysWOW64 and AppData). These behaviors align with tactics designed to evade detection, persist in the system, and facilitate data theft or lateral movement within compromised environments.
