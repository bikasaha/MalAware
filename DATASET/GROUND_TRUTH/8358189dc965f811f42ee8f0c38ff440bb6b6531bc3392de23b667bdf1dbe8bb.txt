The analyzed malware sample exhibits a mix of behavioral and network activities that suggest potentially malicious intent. Behavioral analysis highlights the allocation of read-write-execute (RWX) memory, indicative of unpacking or self-modifying code behavior, via the API NtAllocateVirtualMemory. This suggests evasion or obfuscation techniques. The sample also interacts heavily with the registry, creating and querying numerous keys, indicating potential system persistence or configuration changes. File operations include accessing browser-related files and enumerating user directories, which might indicate credential or information harvesting. Network analysis shows extensive UDP traffic, with communications to multicast addresses (224.0.0.252 and 239.255.255.250) and NetBIOS Name Service (port 137), suggesting attempts to discover or interact with other networked devices, possibly for lateral movement. Functional intelligence reveals the sample as a PE32 Windows executable that loads a range of system DLLs like kernel32.dll and advapi32.dll, commonly used for system-level operations. Combined, these behaviors align with reconnaissance, persistence, and potential data exfiltration capabilities.
