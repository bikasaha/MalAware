The analysis of the provided malware sample reveals key behavioral, network, and functional intelligence insights. The behavioral analysis indicates that the sample heavily interacts with memory, frequently allocating read-write-execute (RWX) regions using the NtProtectVirtualMemory and NtAllocateVirtualMemory APIs, suggesting potential self-unpacking or injection capabilities. Additionally, numerous registry keys are accessed, modified, or queried, primarily related to .NET Framework configurations, indicating a focus on exploiting or leveraging runtime environments. The network analysis shows UDP communication originating from the sample to various multicast and broadcast addresses, such as 224.0.0.252 on port 5355, which may indicate attempts to discover network devices or exfiltrate data using multicast DNS (mDNS). Functional intelligence reveals that the executable is a PE32 format targeting Windows systems, with dependencies on critical libraries like mscoree.dll and AdvApi32.dll. The sampleâ€™s high interaction with system APIs such as NtCreateFile and NtQueryDirectoryFile further highlights its intent to enumerate and manipulate system files, directories, and configurations, aligning with malicious behavior patterns such as reconnaissance or privilege escalation.
