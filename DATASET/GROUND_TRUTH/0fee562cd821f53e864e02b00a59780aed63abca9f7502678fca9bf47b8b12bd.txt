The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis indicates that the malware exhibits behaviors consistent with self-unpacking and code injection, as evidenced by multiple instances of memory allocation with read-write-execute permissions using APIs like NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory. The presence of high entropy sections within the binary suggests the use of encryption or compression, indicative of a packer. Behaviorally, the malware interacts heavily with the Windows registry, opening numerous registry keys and querying values, likely to gather system information or establish persistence. Additionally, it loads critical DLLs like ntdll, kernel32.dll, and others, which are typical for executing system-level tasks.

From a network perspective, the malware demonstrates UDP communication, targeting multicast and broadcast addresses such as 224.0.0.252 on various ports, potentially for discovery or exfiltration purposes. While no HTTP or DNS activity is detected, this UDP behavior may signify reconnaissance or covert data exchange.

Functionally, the malware creates directories, interacts with .NET configuration files, and deletes specific files, suggesting an attempt to manipulate or evade detection in its runtime environment. These activities highlight its sophisticated techniques for maintaining stealth, executing payloads, and achieving its operational goals.
