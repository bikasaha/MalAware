The malware analysis report reveals behavior consistent with advanced evasion and execution techniques. Behaviorally, the malware exhibits process injection by allocating and modifying memory regions (e.g., using NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory with read-write-execute permissions), and resumes suspended threads in remote processes. These actions suggest self-unpacking and stealthy execution. The malware also employs sandbox evasion tactics by scanning active processes (Process32NextW) and modifying remote process threads (NtSetContextThread). High entropy in binary sections indicates possible packing or encryption to obfuscate its payload. From a network perspective, the malware initiates multiple UDP connections to multicast and broadcast addresses (e.g., 224.0.0.252 and 192.168.56.255) on common ports, potentially for discovery or command-and-control purposes. Functional intelligence highlights the use of DLLs related to .NET Framework, indicating the malware might target systems with these dependencies. The overall assessment points to sophisticated capabilities for stealth, execution, and potential lateral movement within compromised environments.
