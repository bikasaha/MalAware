The analysis of the provided Cuckoo Sandbox report highlights significant behavioral and network characteristics of the analyzed malware. Behavioral analysis reveals multiple anti-analysis techniques, including checking for human activity through foreground window changes and delaying analysis using sleep commands. The malware exhibits persistence mechanisms by installing itself as an autorun service, moving its executable to a system folder, and manipulating registry keys. It also uses advanced techniques like memory manipulation and process injection to evade detection and execute malicious code. Functional intelligence points to capabilities like keylogging via a Windows hook, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data.

The network analysis shows a high frequency of UDP connections targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially indicative of lateral movement or command-and-control (C2) communication attempts. Despite the lack of HTTP or DNS activity, the UDP communication to ports such as 5355 (LLMNR) and 1900 (SSDP) suggests attempts to leverage network protocols for furthering its objectives. This combination of anti-analysis tactics, persistence mechanisms, memory injection, and network communication strategies reflects a sophisticated malware design aimed at stealth and resilience.
