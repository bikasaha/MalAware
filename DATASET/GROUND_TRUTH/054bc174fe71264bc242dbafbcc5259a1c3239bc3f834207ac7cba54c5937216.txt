The malware analysis from the Cuckoo Sandbox indicates advanced evasion techniques and malicious behavior. Behavioral analysis reveals the malware allocates executable memory, potentially to unpack itself, and employs anti-sandbox measures such as delaying analysis via sleep functions and checking for foreground window activity. It persists in the system by installing autorun entries and creates hidden files to evade detection. The malware drops executables in the AppData directory and executes them stealthily, alongside modifying registry keys and creating system jobs to ensure persistence.

Network analysis shows extensive UDP traffic targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, possibly for reconnaissance or lateral movement within the network. However, there is no evidence of HTTP or DNS communication in the provided data, suggesting the malwareâ€™s reliance on non-standard or stealthy communication channels.

Functional intelligence highlights the use of high entropy sections within the binary, suggesting encrypted or packed content, likely for obfuscation. The malware also detects the presence of a virtualized environment, indicating its ability to avoid analysis in virtualized sandbox settings. Its capability to manipulate system files and processes, such as moving its executable and creating hidden windows, signifies its sophistication and intent to blend into normal system operations while maintaining control.
