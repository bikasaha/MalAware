The analysis of the provided malware report from the Cuckoo Sandbox highlights significant behavioral and network activities indicative of sophisticated evasion and persistence tactics. Behavioral analysis reveals the malware uses anti-sandbox techniques, such as checking for human activity and employing sleep delays to hinder analysis. It also allocates executable memory, drops binaries in critical locations, and ensures persistence by creating hidden files and autorun tasks. High entropy sections in the binary suggest obfuscation through packing. Additionally, the malware deletes executed files to cover its tracks. Network analysis demonstrates active communication over UDP, targeting broadcast and multicast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or command-and-control (C&C) operations. Functional intelligence points to an emphasis on stealth and resilience, as the malware detects virtual environments (e.g., VMware detection) and actively modifies the registry to enhance persistence. Overall, the observed behaviors align with targeted, evasive malware designed to maintain a foothold in the system while resisting analysis.
