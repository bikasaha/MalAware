The malware exhibits advanced behavioral patterns, including memory manipulations like allocating read-write-execute (RWX) permissions, indicative of code injection or unpacking strategies. It demonstrates persistence mechanisms by installing autorun services and modifying critical system registries. Functionally, the malware creates and deletes executables, such as Nv.exe, which acts as a dropper, and utilizes PlugX-like behaviors, suggesting a possible association with PlugX RAT campaigns. Network analysis highlights UDP-based activity targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for reconnaissance or command-and-control (C2) purposes. The presence of embedded PE files in dumped buffers, language markers (Simplified Chinese), and the exploitation of high-privilege identifiers (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) underline its sophistication. Together, these attributes characterize a stealthy threat with capabilities for persistence, privilege escalation, and evasive maneuvers, necessitating robust detection strategies.
