The malware exhibits sophisticated behavior, leveraging multiple techniques to evade detection, establish persistence, and potentially execute malicious payloads. Behavioral analysis reveals anti-sandboxing mechanisms, including prolonged sleep delays and checks for virtualized environments. Persistence is achieved by adding autorun entries in the Windows registry. The malware creates and executes files in the AppData directory, such as igfxext.exe, indicating a dropper functionality. Additionally, evidence of process injection using APIs like WriteProcessMemory and NtSetContextThread further confirms its evasive and malicious nature.

Network analysis shows UDP traffic, including interactions with multicast and broadcast addresses, suggesting potential reconnaissance or command-and-control communication attempts. Functional intelligence highlights attempts to manipulate proxy configurations and connections to domains that may serve as command-and-control servers, including redlooksman.servehttp.com and individuals.sytes.net. These findings align with typical Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) tactics, showcasing a high-risk malware capable of stealthy data exfiltration and lateral movement.
