The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals that the analyzed executable demonstrates characteristics of malicious behavior, particularly in its attempts to evade detection and persist on the system. Behavioral analysis highlights memory manipulation via frequent allocation of PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE memory regions, a common technique for unpacking and self-modification. The malware also employs anti-sandboxing strategies, such as querying idle system time and inducing significant delays using sleep calls to thwart automated analysis. Persistence mechanisms include modifying registry keys to ensure execution at startup. Network analysis indicates potential lateral movement or reconnaissance activity, with numerous UDP communications targeting broadcast and multicast addresses on ports like 5355 and 1900, commonly associated with service discovery and networking protocols. Functional intelligence suggests the malware copies itself to hidden directories and loads various system libraries to facilitate execution. Overall, the behavior and network patterns signify a sophisticated approach to system compromise and stealth.
