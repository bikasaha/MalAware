The malware exhibits behavior indicative of unpacking mechanisms and potential privilege escalation. Behavioral analysis shows that the executable allocates multiple regions of read-write-execute memory, a technique commonly associated with unpacking or self-modifying code. High entropy values in specific sections of the binary suggest the use of compression or encryption, likely to obfuscate its true functionality. The malware also queries for the "SeDebugPrivilege," hinting at its attempt to elevate privileges for deeper system access. Network analysis reveals UDP traffic targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional intelligence highlights the malware's dependency on core Windows APIs and libraries, such as ntdll, kernel32.dll, and advapi32.dll, with frequent registry and file system interactions. These traits collectively suggest a sophisticated threat aimed at stealth and persistence, warranting further investigation and monitoring for potential indicators of compromise.
