The analyzed malware exhibits behavior consistent with process injection and unpacking techniques, as indicated by its frequent allocation of executable memory (NtAllocateVirtualMemory) and process manipulation (NtSetContextThread, NtResumeThread). The presence of DLL loading and registry activity highlights its efforts to modify system settings and establish persistence. Notably, the malware exhibits sandbox evasion tendencies by scanning running processes and resuming suspended threads in remote processes. Network analysis reveals UDP communication to multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for command-and-control (C2) activity or lateral movement. Functional intelligence suggests the malware attempts to execute code within other processes, leveraging process creation (CreateProcessInternalW) and memory mapping (NtMapViewOfSection). These observations underscore its advanced evasion and propagation capabilities, making it a significant threat.
