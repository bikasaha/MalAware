The malware analysis conducted using Cuckoo Sandbox reveals sophisticated behavior indicating potential Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) characteristics. Behavioral analysis highlights memory manipulation via NtProtectVirtualMemory, indicating self-unpacking mechanisms, and sandbox evasion through delayed execution (antisandbox_sleep). Hidden windows and injected processes point to stealth tactics, while suspicious executable file creation in user directories (amdmftdecoder_32.dll) suggests payload deployment. Network analysis identifies UDP traffic targeting multicast addresses (224.0.0.252) and broadcast destinations, potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional intelligence suggests anti-virtualization techniques, such as querying registry keys and files associated with VirtualBox and VMware, and leveraging WMI queries to assess antivirus and firewall configurations. The malware demonstrates persistence, sandbox evasion, and reconnaissance capabilities, underscoring its threat potential.
