The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals that the malware exhibits advanced behavioral, network, and functional characteristics indicative of sophisticated attack capabilities. Behaviorally, it allocates executable memory to unpack itself and employs anti-sandbox techniques, such as delaying execution and interacting with virtual machine indicators like network adapter checks. Functionally, it creates and modifies executable files in critical directories like the AppData folder and alters proxy configurations via registry keys, suggesting an attempt to intercept or redirect network traffic. Network analysis indicates UDP communication targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for lateral movement or reconnaissance. Additionally, the binary shows high entropy, typical of packed or encrypted files, hinting at obfuscation techniques to evade detection. These activities highlight the malwareâ€™s capability to bypass traditional defenses and perform unauthorized operations on the host system.
