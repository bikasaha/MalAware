The malware sample analyzed in the Cuckoo Sandbox demonstrates advanced techniques indicative of sophisticated malicious behavior. Behavioral analysis reveals heavy reliance on process injection and memory manipulation, including the use of NtSetContextThread and NtProtectVirtualMemory to modify remote process threads and allocate executable memory segments (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE). This suggests the malware employs stealthy unpacking routines and likely executes malicious payloads in memory to evade detection. It also interacts with several Windows registry keys and heavily loads .NET framework DLLs, indicating potential targeting of .NET-based environments. Network analysis shows UDP communications to multicast and broadcast addresses, potentially for reconnaissance or lateral movement, though no HTTP or DNS activity was observed in this execution. Functional intelligence highlights its use of high-entropy sections, likely indicative of encrypted or compressed data used for packing, along with the resumption of suspended threads, pointing to runtime injection and anti-analysis strategies. The combined behaviors and network activity suggest the malware is crafted for stealthy execution and may serve as a component in multi-stage attacks.
