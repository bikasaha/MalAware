The malware analysis from the Cuckoo Sandbox highlights a sophisticated threat leveraging a range of advanced tactics. Behavioral Analysis reveals the malware engages in multiple process injections (e.g., CreateRemoteThread and WriteProcessMemory), indicative of its capability to execute code in the context of other processes. It exhibits persistence mechanisms, such as creating an autorun entry (dmservers) and a Windows service, while anti-sandbox techniques (e.g., sleep delays and foreground window checks) aim to evade detection. Network Analysis indicates minimal external communication; however, the UDP traffic to local and multicast addresses suggests potential reconnaissance or lateral movement strategies. Functional Intelligence underscores the malware's capability to allocate executable memory regions (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE), suggesting unpacking or dynamic code execution. It manipulates system processes (explorer.exe), loads malicious DLLs (winkey.dll), and modifies registry keys, all aimed at maintaining control over the infected environment. These behaviors align with APT-style intrusion tactics, making this malware a significant threat to both individual and organizational systems.
