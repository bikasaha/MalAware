The analysis from the Cuckoo Sandbox report highlights notable behavioral and network activities of a malware sample. Behavioral analysis reveals the malware's capability to modify memory protections to enable execution, allocate large memory regions, and create executable files in system directories, such as the user AppData folder. Persistence is established through autorun installation and service creation. The malware actively interacts with the system by loading DLLs, reading and writing critical configuration files, modifying registry keys, and utilizing system APIs like NtProtectVirtualMemory and NtAllocateVirtualMemory extensively. Network analysis indicates multiple UDP communications targeting broadcast and multicast IP ranges, leveraging ports associated with NetBIOS and DNS services, suggesting reconnaissance or communication for further exploitation. Functional intelligence identifies potential evasion tactics, including dropping executable files with embedded PE content and checking for privileged system identifiers (SeDebugPrivilege). These behaviors, combined with observed file and process manipulations, showcase a multi-faceted strategy to ensure execution, persistence, and evasion, characteristic of advanced malicious threats.
