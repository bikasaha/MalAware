The analysis of the Cuckoo Sandbox report reveals that the malware exhibits several suspicious behaviors indicative of its malicious intent. Behavioral analysis shows the malware dynamically allocates executable memory (NtProtectVirtualMemory) and creates, drops, and executes files, including registering them for persistence at startup via autorun registry keys. The binary likely contains packed or encrypted data as indicated by high entropy values in specific sections, suggesting the use of a packer. Additionally, it deletes its executable traces from the disk to evade detection and stops Windows services, which could disrupt normal system operations. Network analysis identifies UDP communication targeting broadcast and multicast addresses, potentially signaling reconnaissance or peer-to-peer communication behavior. Furthermore, the malware checks for virtual network adapters, hinting at anti-analysis measures to detect sandbox environments. Functional intelligence highlights privilege escalation attempts by querying system privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeShutdownPrivilege, etc.) and attempts to load drivers for deeper system integration. These capabilities, combined with registry modifications and dropped DLLs, point toward its adaptability in compromising system integrity and persistence.
