The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis highlights critical behavioral, network, and functional aspects of the submitted sample. Behavioral analysis indicates the presence of a potential packer, evidenced by high entropy in the .data section and overall file entropy, suggesting encryption or compression to obscure analysis. The malware demonstrates bootkit behavior by performing raw hard disk modifications through API calls like NtCreateFile and NtWriteFile, targeting \\??\\PhysicalDrive0, indicative of low-level disk access to potentially persist across reboots. Additionally, registry activity reveals the creation of keys with large binary values, likely for storing configurations or payloads. Network-related activities were not detailed, but the overall severity of observed behaviors, such as file and registry manipulations and possible installation of bootkits, suggests advanced evasion and persistence techniques. This intelligence underscores the malware's sophisticated nature and its intent to remain undetected while establishing long-term control.
