The malware exhibited behaviors indicative of sophisticated evasion and persistence mechanisms. Behavioral analysis reveals the allocation of executable memory and the use of hidden windows, suggesting potential unpacking and stealth execution techniques. File operations included dropping and executing a binary in the userâ€™s AppData folder, accompanied by creating and subsequently deleting associated files, hinting at anti-forensics tactics. The malware's network activity, while minimal, demonstrated potential reconnaissance behavior by querying local network adapters and sending UDP packets to multicast addresses. Functional intelligence highlighted its Virtual Machine detection capabilities via VirtualBox-specific files and devices, indicating an attempt to evade sandbox analysis. These behaviors, combined with the observed persistence techniques and API usage, suggest this malware is part of a larger campaign targeting user environments with obfuscation and stealth at its core.
