The malware analyzed exhibits behaviors indicative of sophisticated evasion and persistence tactics. Behavioral analysis reveals that the sample allocates executable memory and delays analysis by manipulating sleep APIs, a common anti-sandbox technique. It creates and hides files, such as api3h.exe, in the userâ€™s AppData directory and configures persistence via registry autorun entries. Network activity includes UDP communications targeting broadcast and multicast addresses, possibly for lateral movement or reconnaissance. Functional intelligence highlights potential packing and obfuscation with high entropy in specific sections of the binary, as well as modifications to WPAD proxy settings, likely for intercepting network traffic. The sample's ability to delete files post-execution and its use of common DLLs further emphasize its evasive nature. These behaviors collectively underscore the malware's capabilities for stealth, persistence, and potential data exfiltration.
