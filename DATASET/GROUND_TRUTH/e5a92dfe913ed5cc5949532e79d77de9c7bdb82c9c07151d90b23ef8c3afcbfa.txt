The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis indicates significant malicious behaviors and network activity associated with the executable. Behavioral analysis reveals that the malware employs anti-sandbox techniques, such as delaying execution through sleep calls, checking for virtual machine network adapters, and querying registry keys to evade detection. It exhibits persistence by installing itself for autorun on Windows startup and modifies system registry settings, including proxy configurations, to facilitate traffic interception. Functional intelligence highlights code injection techniques, including memory writing and thread context modification, pointing to advanced process injection methods. Network analysis shows repeated UDP broadcasts to multicast addresses, which could indicate reconnaissance or Command and Control (C2) activity. Additionally, connections to suspicious domains suggest possible data exfiltration or coordination with a remote server. Overall, the malware displays stealthy persistence mechanisms, network communication capabilities, and advanced evasion tactics, indicating a well-engineered threat.
