The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis highlights significant behavioral and network characteristics of the submitted malware, demonstrating advanced functionality and evasion techniques. Behaviorally, the malware exhibits persistence by installing itself for autorun and engages in process injection using NtSetContextThread and WriteProcessMemory, indicative of its capability to evade detection and manipulate other processes. Additionally, it creates and executes binaries in the user AppData directory, changes memory protection settings, and modifies WPAD proxy configurations, signaling its intent to intercept traffic. Anti-analysis measures such as extended sleep delays and checks for virtual environments (via CPU registry inspection and network adapter queries) further reinforce its sophistication. Network analysis reveals frequent UDP traffic to multicast and broadcast addresses, suggesting reconnaissance or command-and-control communication. The functionality intelligence derived from its activity points to its ability to inject code, manipulate threads, and exploit memory, making it a potential tool for data exfiltration or lateral movement within networks. Overall, this malware demonstrates a well-rounded arsenal of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typical of a sophisticated threat actor.
