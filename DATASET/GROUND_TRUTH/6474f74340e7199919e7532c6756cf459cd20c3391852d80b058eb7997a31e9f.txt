The analyzed malware, identified as a PE32 executable, exhibits several suspicious behaviors and functionalities indicative of malicious activity. Behaviorally, it dynamically allocates significant read-write-execute (RWX) memory regions, commonly associated with unpacking routines, and loads multiple DLLs, including system-critical libraries like kernel32.dll and ntdll.dll. The binary's entropy analysis reveals high entropy in key sections, suggesting the use of encryption or packing techniques to obfuscate its payload. Functionally, it queries and manipulates sensitive registry keys, accesses system configuration files, and attempts to leverage privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, indicative of reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts. Network analysis shows repetitive UDP communication with multicast and broadcast addresses, hinting at potential lateral movement or beaconing behavior. These traits collectively align with stealthy and adaptable malware, demanding further investigation to assess its full impact and intent.
