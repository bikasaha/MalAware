The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis highlights the suspicious behavior of the malware sample, identified as a PE32 executable for Windows, with a high behavioral score of 0.8. The behavioral analysis reveals frequent memory allocation with read-write-execute (RWX) permissions, likely indicative of self-unpacking mechanisms, and extensive interaction with Windows registry keys and system APIs, including frequent calls to NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory. Functional intelligence points to the execution of DLLs and manipulation of .NET Framework components, suggesting evasion and persistence strategies. The network analysis demonstrates UDP traffic to broadcast and multicast addresses, targeting ports such as 137, 138, and 5355, which could indicate lateral movement or reconnaissance activities. While no HTTP, DNS, or ICMP traffic was detected, the malwareâ€™s behaviors strongly suggest its capability to perform malicious activities such as privilege escalation, system compromise, and data exfiltration.
