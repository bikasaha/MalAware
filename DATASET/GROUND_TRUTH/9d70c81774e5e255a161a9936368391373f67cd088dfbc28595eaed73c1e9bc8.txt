The malware analysis report reveals behavioral patterns indicative of advanced evasive and potentially malicious activities. Behavioral analysis highlights the allocation of executable memory (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE) and frequent calls to memory allocation APIs such as NtAllocateVirtualMemory and NtProtectVirtualMemory, which suggest unpacking and self-modifying capabilities. The use of APIs like NtSetContextThread and NtResumeThread for process injection, coupled with the execution of a suspended process, signals potential code injection. Network analysis shows UDP communications from the malware to multicast addresses, targeting various ports (e.g., 5355, 137), possibly for local network reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional intelligence identifies the presence of high-entropy sections indicative of packed or encrypted payloads and the injection of malicious code into remote processes. These behaviors align with sophisticated malware characteristics aimed at obfuscation, persistence, and potential exploitation of network environments.
