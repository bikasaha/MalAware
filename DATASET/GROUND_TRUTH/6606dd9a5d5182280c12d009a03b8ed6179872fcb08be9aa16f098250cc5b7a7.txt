The malware analysis conducted using Cuckoo Sandbox reveals significant behavioral and network activities indicative of malicious intent. Behavioral Analysis highlights that the sample employs process injection techniques (WriteProcessMemory and NtAllocateVirtualMemory) to manipulate the memory of non-child processes, indicative of stealthy execution. It also demonstrates persistence mechanisms, such as creating autorun registry entries, and employs anti-sandbox techniques like delaying execution (NtDelayExecution) and monitoring user activity (GetForegroundWindow). Network Analysis reveals multiple UDP communications, including broadcasts to multicast addresses like 224.0.0.252 and 239.255.255.250, potentially indicative of reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional Intelligence uncovers that the malware allocates read-write-execute memory regions and dynamically loads malicious DLLs, suggesting unpacking and execution of malicious payloads. Together, these behaviors showcase a complex, evasive threat with capabilities for persistence, stealth, and potential network exploitation.
