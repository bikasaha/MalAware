The analysis of the provided Cuckoo Sandbox malware report highlights significant behavioral, network, and functional intelligence. The malware demonstrates self-unpacking behavior by allocating large blocks of executable memory (NtAllocateVirtualMemory) and shows persistence techniques by creating autorun registry keys and modifying proxy configurations (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Haizi and WPAD settings). Additionally, the sample interacts with numerous network interfaces and virtual adapters, indicative of anti-virtual machine checks (GetAdaptersAddresses). Behavioral analysis shows file creation (svchost.exe) and registry modifications to maintain persistence and redirect traffic. Network analysis indicates UDP traffic directed toward multicast and broadcast addresses (224.0.0.252 and 192.168.56.255), likely for discovery or control purposes. High entropy within the binary suggests the use of packing or encryption, and the detection of mutexes (svchost Avoid Double-Running) confirms efforts to evade re-execution. Functionally, the malware appears well-equipped to maintain stealth, intercept traffic, and establish a foothold on the target system, representing a significant threat.
