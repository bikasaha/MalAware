The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals that the analyzed malware exhibits advanced evasion, persistence, and network communication behaviors, scoring a critical 8.6 severity rating. Behaviorally, the malware leverages anti-analysis techniques such as prolonged sleep delays and anti-virtualization checks targeting CPU and network adapters. It employs persistence mechanisms by modifying autorun registry keys and creates executable files in the userâ€™s AppData directory. Functionally, the malware performs process injection, including memory writing and thread modification, to execute and embed malicious code into legitimate processes. Network activity includes UDP traffic to multicast addresses and potential connections to suspicious hosts like redlooksman.servehttp.com, indicative of Command-and-Control (C2) communication. These findings underline the malware's capabilities to bypass detection, maintain a foothold, and facilitate remote control, emphasizing its sophistication and potential threat level.
