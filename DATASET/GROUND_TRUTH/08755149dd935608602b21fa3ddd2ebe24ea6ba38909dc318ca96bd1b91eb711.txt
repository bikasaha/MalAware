The analysis of the provided malware sample reveals sophisticated behavior indicative of evasive and persistent strategies. Behaviorally, the malware exhibits suspicious activity such as allocating executable memory, creating hidden windows, delaying analysis with prolonged sleep, and modifying the system's proxy configurations. Persistence mechanisms include setting autorun entries in the registry and dropping malicious DLLs in system directories. Network analysis indicates potential reconnaissance, leveraging UDP broadcasts to multicast addresses for network discovery. However, no HTTP or DNS activity was observed. Functional intelligence highlights the use of packers, with high entropy in executable sections, suggesting obfuscation. The sample leverages Windows utilities like cmd.exe and rundll32.exe for execution and cleanup, showcasing a combination of stealth and system manipulation to avoid detection. Overall, the malware's behavior aligns with techniques commonly employed by advanced threats to evade sandbox environments and ensure persistence.
