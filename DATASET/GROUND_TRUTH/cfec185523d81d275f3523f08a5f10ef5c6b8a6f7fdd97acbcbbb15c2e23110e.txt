The analysis of the provided malware sample reveals several behavioral and functional characteristics indicative of malicious activity. Behavioral Analysis: The malware attempts to evade detection through anti-sandbox techniques, such as querying system idle time (NtQuerySystemInformation) and significantly delaying analysis via prolonged sleep (NtDelayExecution). Additionally, it achieves persistence by modifying the Windows registry to autorun upon startup (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run). The malware actively allocates read-write-execute memory regions (NtAllocateVirtualMemory) and protects them for execution, suggesting unpacking or shellcode injection functionality. Network Analysis: The malware generates substantial UDP traffic, targeting multicast and broadcast addresses, which may facilitate network reconnaissance or data exfiltration. Functional Intelligence: The sample copies itself to a directory under the userâ€™s roaming profile and interacts with numerous DLLs and Windows APIs related to process and memory management, highlighting its capability for process injection or further code execution. These behaviors collectively suggest the malware is designed for stealthy persistence, potential lateral movement, and evasion within a networked environment.
