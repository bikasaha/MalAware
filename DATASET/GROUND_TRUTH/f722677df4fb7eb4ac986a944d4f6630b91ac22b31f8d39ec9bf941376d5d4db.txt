The Cuckoo Sandbox analysis reveals a malware sample that demonstrates sophisticated behavior and anti-analysis techniques. Behavioral analysis highlights actions such as the allocation of read-write-execute memory, potentially for unpacking itself, and attempts to delay analysis using prolonged sleep instructions. The malware creates and drops executable files in the AppData directory, suggesting potential persistence mechanisms. Notably, it interacts with Windows utilities and creates hidden processes, indicating stealth techniques. Network analysis shows UDP traffic to multicast addresses, potentially for network reconnaissance or lateral movement. Functional intelligence points to anti-virtualization and anti-sandboxing tactics, including BIOS and registry checks for virtualization artifacts, leveraging WMI queries to gather system details, and using Windows utilities to delete evidence post-execution. These findings suggest a focus on evasion, persistence, and reconnaissance, characteristic of advanced threats.
